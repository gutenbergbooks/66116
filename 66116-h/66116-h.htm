</div>


<p>This book is the outcome of work undertaken in Greece during
my two years’ tenure of the Craven Studentship from 1898
to 1900. It is therefore my first duty gratefully to commemorate
John, Lord Craven, to whose benefactions of two and a half centuries
ago I owed my opportunity for research.</p>

<p>The scheme of work originally proposed was the investigation
of the customs and superstitions of modern Greece in their
possible bearing upon the life and thought of ancient Greece;
and to the Managers of the Craven Fund at that time, with
whom was associated Mr R. A. Neil of Pembroke College to
whose memory I have dedicated this book, I render hearty thanks
for their willingness to encourage a venture new in direction,
vague in scope, and possibly void of result.</p>

<p>The course of research proposed was one which required as the
first condition of any success considerable readiness in speaking
and understanding the popular language, and to the attainment
of this my first few months were necessarily devoted. When once
the ear has become accustomed to the modern pronunciation, a
knowledge of ancient Greek makes for rapid progress; and some
three or four months spent chiefly in the <i>cafés</i> of small provincial
towns rendered me fairly proficient in ordinary conversation.
Subsequent practice enabled me also to follow conversations not
intended for my ear; and on more than one occasion I obtained
from the talk of peasants thus overheard information which they
might have been chary of imparting to a stranger.</p>

<p>The time at my disposal however, after I had sufficiently mastered
the language, would have been far too short to allow of any complete
enquiry into the beliefs and customs of the country, had it not been
for the existence of two books, <i>Das Volksleben der Neugriechen und
das Hellenische Alterthum</i> by Bernhard Schmidt, and <span class="greek">Μελέτη ἐπὶ
τοῦ βίου τῶν νεωτέρων Ἑλλήνων</span> by Professor Polites of Athens
University, which at once supplied me with a working knowledge
of the subject which I was studying and suggested certain directions
in which further research might profitably be pursued. My debt
to these two books is repeatedly acknowledged in the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
pages; and if I have given references to Schmidt’s work more
frequently than to that of Polites, my reason is not that I owe less
to the latter, but merely that the former is more generally accessible.</p>

<p>In pursuit of my task I followed no special system. I have
known of those who professed to obtain a complete knowledge of
the folklore of a given village in the course of a few hours’ visit,
and whose method was to provide themselves with an introduction
to the schoolmaster, who would generally be not even a native of
the place, and to read out to him a formidable <i>questionnaire</i>, in the
charitable and misplaced expectation that the answers given would
be prompted not by courtesy and loquacity, which are the attributes
of most Greeks, but by veracity, which is the attribute of few.
The formal interview with paper and pencil is in my opinion a
mistake. The ‘educated’ Greek whose pose is to despise the
traditions of the common-folk will discourse upon them no less
tediously than inaccurately for the sake of having his vapourings
put on record; but the peasant who honestly believes the superstitions
and scrupulously observes the customs of which he may
happen to speak is silenced at once by the sight of a note-book.
Apart however from this objection to being interviewed, the countryfolk
are in general communicative enough. They do not indeed
expect to be plied with questions until their own curiosity concerning
the new-comer has been satisfied, and even then any questions on
uncanny subjects must be discreetly introduced. But it is no
difficult matter to start some suitable topic. A wedding, a funeral,
or some local <i>fête</i> perhaps is in progress, and your host is eager to
have the distinction of escorting you to it and explaining all the
customs appropriate to the occasion. You have been taken to see
the village-church, and some offering there dedicated, to which you
call attention, elicits the story of some supernatural ‘seizure’ and
miraculous cure. You express a desire to visit some cave which
you have observed in the mountain-side, and the dissuasion and
excuses which follow form the prelude to an account of the fearful
beings by whom it is haunted. Your guide crosses himself or spits
before fording a stream, and you enquire, once safely across, what
is the particular danger at this spot. Your mule perhaps rolls with
your baggage in the same stream, and the muleteer’s imprecations
suggest luridly novel conceptions of the future life.</p>

<p>Much also may be effected by playing upon patriotism or vanity
or, let it be confessed, love of lucre. You relate some story heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
in a neighbouring village or praise some custom there observed,
and the peasant’s parochial patriotism is up in arms to prove the
superiority of his native hamlet. You show perhaps some signs
of incredulity (but not until your informant is well launched upon
his panegyric), and his wounded pride bids him call in his neighbours
to corroborate his story. Or again you may hint at a little largesse,
not of course for your host&mdash;only witches and the professional
reciters of folk-tales and ballads are entitled to a fee&mdash;but
on behalf of his children, and he may pardon and satisfy what
might otherwise have seemed too inquisitive a curiosity.</p>

<p>Such are the folk to whom I am most beholden, and how shall
I fitly acknowledge my debt to them? Their very names maybe
were unknown to me even then, or at the most a ‘John’ or ‘George’
sufficed; and they in turn knew not that I was in their debt.
You, muleteers and boatmen, who drove shrewd bargains for your
services and gave unwittingly so much beside, and you too, cottagers,
who gave a night’s lodging to a stranger and never guessed that
your chatter was more prized than your shelter, how shall I thank
you? Not severally, for I cannot write nor could you ever read
the list of acknowledgements due; but to you all, Georges and
Johns, Demetris and Constantines, and rare anachronistic
Epaminondases, in memory of services rendered unawares, greeting
from afar and true gratitude!</p>

<p>Nor must I omit to mention the assistance which I have
derived from written sources. In recent times it has been a
favourite amusement with Greeks of some education to compile
little histories of the particular district or island in which they
live, and many of these contain a chapter devoted to the customs
and superstitions of the locality. From these, as also from the
records of travel in Greece, particularly those of French writers
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, I have culled much
that is valuable.</p>

<p>Nearly ten years have passed since my return from Greece,
and such leisure as they have allowed has been devoted to
co-ordinating the piecemeal information which I personally obtained
or have gathered from the writings of others, and to examining
its bearing upon the life and thought of Ancient Greece. In the
former half of this task I have but followed in the steps of
Bernhard Schmidt and of Polites, who had already presented
a coherent, if still incomplete, account of the folklore of Modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
Greece, and my work has been mainly to check, to correct, and
to amplify; but for the latter half I would ask the indulgent
consideration which may fairly be extended to a pioneer. Analogies
and coincidences in the beliefs and customs of modern and of
ancient Greece have indeed been pointed out by others; but no
large attempt has previously been made to trace the continuity
of the life and thought of the Greek people, and to exhibit modern
Greek folklore as an essential factor in the interpretation of ancient
Greek religion.</p>

<p>It is my hope that this book will prove interesting not to
Greek scholars only, but to readers who have little or no
acquaintance with Greek. All quotations whether from the
ancient or modern language are translated, and references to
ancient and modern writers are distinguished by the use of the
ordinary Latinised names and titles in the case of the former,
and the retention of the Greek character for denoting the latter.
As regards the transliteration of modern Greek words, I have
made no attempt to represent the exact sound, except to indicate
in some words the accented syllable and to make the obvious
substitution of the English <i>v</i> for the Greek <span class="greek">β</span>; but to replace
<span class="greek">γ</span> by <i>gh</i> and <span class="greek">δ</span> by <i>dh</i>, as is sometimes done, gives to words an
uncouth appearance without assisting the majority of readers
in their pronunciation.</p>

<p>It remains only to express my thanks to the reviser of my
proofs, Mr W. S. Hadley of Pembroke College, but these are the
hardest to express adequately. I was conscious of making no
small demand on the kindness of the Tutor of a large College
when I asked him to do me this service; and I am conscious now
that any words in acknowledgement of his kindness are a poor
expression of my gratitude for the generous measure of time and
of trouble which he has expended on each page.</p>

<p>Lastly I would thank the Syndics of the University Press for
their willingness to undertake the publication of this book, and
the staff of the Press for their unfailing courtesy in the course
of its preparation.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 1. <span class="smcap">Modern Folklore as a source for the
study of Ancient Religion.</span></h3>

<p>The sources of information most obviously open to the
student of ancient Greek religion are the Art and the Literature
of ancient Greece; and the idea that modern Greece can have
any teaching to impart concerning the beliefs of more than two
thousand years ago seems seldom to have been entertained. Just
as we speak of ancient Greek as a dead language, and too often
forget that many of the words and inflexions in popular use at
the present day are identical with those of the classical period
and even of the Homeric age, while many others, no longer
identical, have suffered only a slight modification, so are we apt
to think of Greek paganism as a dead religion, and do not enquire
whether the beliefs and customs of the modern peasant may not
be a direct heritage from his classical forefathers. And yet, if
any such heritage exist, there is clearly a fresh source of knowledge
open to us, from which to supplement and to correct the
lessons of Art and Literature.</p>

<p>Art, by its very nature, serves rather as illustration than as
proof of any theory of ancient religion. Sculpture has preserved
to us the old conceptions of the divine personalities. Vase-paintings
record many acts of ritual and scenes of worship.
Architectural remains allow us to restore in imagination the
grandeur of holy places. But these things are only the externals
of religion: they need an interpreter, if we would understand
the spirit which informed them: and however able the
interpreter, the material with which he deals is so small a
remnant of the treasures of ancient art, that from day to day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
some fresh discovery may subvert his precariously founded
theories. Though all would acknowledge how fruitful in religious
suggestion the evidence of art has proved when handled by competent
critics, none would claim that that evidence either in its
scope, which the losses of time have limited, or in its accuracy,
which depends upon conjectural interpretation, is a complete
or infallible guide to the knowledge of ancient religion.</p>

<p>From literature more might be expected, and more indeed
is forthcoming, though not perhaps where the modern mind,
with its tendency to methodical analysis, would look for it. If
anyone should attempt to classify ancient Greek literature in
modern fashion, under the headings of religion, science, history,
drama, and so forth, he would remark one apparent deficiency.
While history, philosophy, and poetry of every kind are amply
represented and, however much has perished to be read no more,
the choicest blossoms and richest fruit of Greek toil in these
fields have been preserved to us, religion seems at first sight to
have been almost barren of literary produce. The department of
religion pure and simple would have little beyond an Hesiodic
Theogony or some Orphic Hymns to exhibit,&mdash;and even these have
little enough bearing upon real religion. In short, it is not on
any special branch of Greek literature, but rather upon the whole
bulk thereof, that the student of Greek religion must rely. He
must recognize that a religious spirit pervades the whole; that
there is hardly a book in the language but has some allusion
to religious beliefs and customs, to cults and ceremonies and
divine personalities. And while recognizing this, he must still
admit the fact that nowhere is there found any definite exposition
of accepted beliefs as a whole, any statement of doctrine,
any creed which except a man believe he cannot be saved. How
are we to reconcile these two facts,&mdash;the constant presence of
religion in all Greek literature, and the almost total absence of
any literature appertaining to religion only? The answer to
this question must be sought in the character of the religion
itself.</p>

<p>Greek religion differed from the chief now existing religions
of the world in its origin and development. It had no founder.
Its sanction was not the <i>ipse dixit</i> of some inspired teacher.
It possessed nothing analogous to the Gospel of Jesus Christ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
or the Koran. It was a free, autochthonous growth, evolved
from the various hopes and fears of a whole people. If we
could catch a glimpse of it in its infancy, we should probably
deny to it the very name of religion, and call it superstition or
folklore. Great teachers indeed arose, like Orpheus, advocating
special doctrines and imposing upon their followers special rules
of life. Great centres of religious influence were developed, such
as Delphi, exercising a general control over rites and ceremonies.
But no single preacher, no priesthood, succeeded in dominating
over the free conscience of the people. Nothing was imposed
by authority. In belief and in worship each man was a law
unto himself; and so far as there were any accepted doctrines
and established observances, these were not the subtle inventions
of professional theologians or an interested priesthood, but were
based upon the hereditary and innate convictions of the whole
Greek race. The individual was free to believe what he would
and what he could; it was the general, if vague, consensus of
the masses which constituted the real religion of Greece. The
<i>vox populi</i> fully established itself as the <i>vox dei</i>.</p>

<p>Again in this popular religion, when it had emerged from its
earliest and crudest form and had reached the definitely anthropomorphic
stage in which we know it, we can discern no trace of
any tendency towards monotheism. The idea of a single supreme
deity, personal or impersonal, appealed only to some of the
greatest thinkers: the mass of the people remained frankly
polytheistic. For this reason the development of Greek religion
proceeded on very different lines from that of Hebrew religion.
The earliest Jewish conception of a God ‘walking in the
garden in the cool of the day’ was certainly no less anthropomorphic
than the Homeric presentation of the Olympian deities:
but the subsequent growth of Judaism was like that of some tall
straight palm tree lifting its head to purer air than is breathed
by men; whereas Greek religion resembled rather the cedar
spreading wide its branches nearer the earth. The Jew, by concentrating
in one unique being every transcendent quality and
function, exalted gradually his idea of godhead far above the
anthropomorphic plane: the Greek multiplied his gods to be the
several incarnations of passions and powers and activities pertaining
also, though in less fulness, to mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>It is obvious that in point of simplicity and consistency the
monotheistic system must prove superior. As the worshipper’s
intellectual and spiritual capacities develop, he discards the
older and cruder notions in favour of a more enlightened ideal.
Abraham’s crude conception of the deity as a being to whom
even human sacrifice would be acceptable was necessarily rejected
by an humaner age to whom was delivered the message ‘I will
have mercy and not sacrifice.’ In the growth of Greek polytheism,
on the contrary, the new did not supersede the old, but was
superimposed upon it. Fresh conceptions were expressed by the
creation or acceptance of fresh gods, but the venerable embodiments
of more primitive beliefs were not necessarily displaced by
them. The development of humaner ideas in one cult was no bar
to the retention of barbarous rites by another. The same deity
under different titles of invocation (<span class="greek">ἐπωνυμίαι</span>) was invested with
different and even conflicting characters: and reversely the same
religious idea found several expressions in the cults of widely
different deities. The forms of worship, viewed in the mass, were
of an inconsistent and chaotic complexity. Human sacrifice, we
may be sure, was a thing abhorrent to the majority of the cults of
Zeus: yet Lycaean Zeus continued to exact his toll of human life
down to the time of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. The worship of Dionysus embodied
something of the same religious spirit which pervaded the
teachings of Orpheus and the mysteries of Demeter, and came to
be closely allied with them: yet neither the austerity of Orphism
nor the real spirituality of the Eleusinian cult succeeded in
mitigating the wild orgies of the Bacchant or in repressing the
savage rite of <i>omophagia</i> in which drunken fanatics tore a bull
to pieces with their teeth. Aphrodite was worshipped under
two incompatible titles: in the <i>rôle</i> of the ‘Heavenly’ (<span class="greek">οὐρανία</span>),
says Artemidorus<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, she looks favourably upon marriage and childbirth
and the home life, while under her title of ‘Popular’
(<span class="greek">πάνδημος</span>) she is hostile to the matron, and patroness of laxer
ties. It is needless to multiply illustrations. The forms in which
the religious spirit of Greece found embodiment are beyond
question confused and mutually inconsistent. The same religious
idea might be expressed in so great a variety of rites, and the
same divine personality might be associated with so great a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
variety of ideas, that no formal exposition of Greek religion as
a whole was possible. The verbal limitations of a creed, a <i>summa
theologiae</i>, would have been too narrow for the free, imaginative
faith of Greece. It was a necessary condition of Hellenic polytheism
that, as it came into being without any personal founder,
without any authoritative sacred books, so in its development
it should be hampered and confined neither by priestcraft nor
by any literature purely and distinctively religious. The spirit
which manifested itself in a myriad forms of worship could not
brook the restraint of any one form of words.</p>

<p>And not only would it have been difficult to give adequate
expression to the essential ideas of Greek religion, but there
was no motive for attempting the task. Those of the philosophers
who dealt with religion wrote and taught for the reason
that they had some new idea, some fresh doctrine, to advance.
Plato certainly abounds in references to the popular beliefs of his
age: but his object is not to expound them for their own sake:
rather he utilizes them as illustration and ornament of his own
philosophical views: his treatment of them in the main is artistic,
not scientific. In fact there was no one interested in giving to
popular beliefs an authoritative and dogmatic expression. There
was no hierarchy concerned to arrest the free progress of thought
or to chain men’s minds to the faith of their forefathers. A
summary of popular doctrines, if it could have been written, would
have had no readers, for the simple reason that the people felt their
religion more truly and fully than the writer could express it: and
few men have the interests of posterity so largely at heart, as
to write what their own contemporaries will certainly not read.
Thus it appears that there was neither motive nor means for
treating the popular religion in literary form: to formulate the
common-folk’s creed, to analyse the common-folk’s religion, was
a thing neither desired nor feasible.</p>

<p>But because we observe an almost total absence of distinctively
religious literature, we need not for that reason be surprised at
the constant presence of religious feeling in all that a Greek
wrote or sang. Rather it was consistent with that freedom and
that absence of all control and circumscription which we have
noted, that religion should pervade the whole life of the people,
whose hearts were its native soil, and should consequently pervade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
also the literature in which their thoughts and doings are recorded.
For religion with them was not a single and separate department
of their civilisation, not an avocation from the ordinary pursuits
of men, but rather a spirit with which work and holiday, gaiety
and gloom, were alike penetrated. We should be misled by the
modern devotion to dogma and definite formulae of faith, were we
to think that so vague a religion as Greek polytheism was any
the less an abiding force, any the less capable of inspiring genuine
enthusiasm and reverence. It is not hard to imagine the worshipper
animated for the time by one emotion only, his mind void
of all else and flooded with the one idea incarnate in the divine
being at whose altar he sat in supplication. It is impossible really
to misdoubt the strength and the depth of Greek religious sentiment,
however multifarious and even mutually contradictory its
modes of display. A nation who peopled sky and earth and
sea with godlike forms; who saw in every stream and glen and
mountain-top its own haunting, hallowing presence, and, ill-content
that nature alone should do them honour, sought out the loveliest
hills and vales in all their lovely land to dedicate there the choicest
of their art; who consecrated with lavish love bronze and marble,
ivory and gold, all the best that wealth could win and skill adorn,
in honour of the beings that were above man yet always with him,
majestic as Zeus, joyous as Dionysus, grave as Demeter, light as
Aphrodite, yet all divine; such a nation, though it knew nought
of inspired books and formulated creeds, can be convicted of no
shortcoming in real piety and devotion.</p>

<p>Their gods were very near to those whom they favoured; no
communion or intercourse was beyond hope of attainment; gods
fought in men’s battles, guided men’s wanderings, dined at men’s
boards, and took to themselves mortal consorts; and when men
grew degenerate and the race of heroes was no more, gods still
held speech with them in oracles. Religious hopes, religious fears,
were the dominant motive of the people’s whole life. It was
in religion that sculpture found its inspiration, and its highest
achievements were in pourtraying deities. The theatre was a
religious institution, and on the stage, without detriment to
reverence, figured the Eumenides themselves. Religious duties
were excuse enough for Sparta to hang back from defending the
freedom of Greece. Religious scruples set enlightened Athens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
in an uproar, because a number of idols were decently mutilated.
Religious fears cost her the loss of the proudest armament that
ever sailed from her shores. A charge of irreligion was pretext
enough for condemning to death her noblest philosopher. In
everything, great and small, the pouring of libations at the feast,
the taking of omens before battle, the consulting of the Delphic
oracle upon the most important or most trivial of occasions, the
same spirit is manifest. Religion used or abused, piety or superstition,
was to the Greeks an abiding motive and influence in all
the affairs of life.</p>

<p>It is chiefly of these definite doings and customs that literature
tells us, just as art depicts the <i>mise-en-scène</i> of religion. Yet it
would be inconceivable that a people who displayed so strong and
so abundant a religious feeling in all the circumstances and tasks
of life, should not have pondered over the essential underlying
questions of all religion, the nature of the soul and the mystery of
life and death. Literature tells us that to their poets and philosophers
these problems did present themselves, and many were
the solutions which different thinkers propounded: but of the
general sense of the people in this respect, of the fundamental
beliefs which guided their conduct towards gods and men in this
life and prompted their care for the dead, literature furnishes no
direct statement: its evidence is fragmentary, casual, sporadic.
Everywhere it displays the externals, but it leaves the inner
spirit veiled. Literature as well as art needs an interpreter.</p>

<p>It is precisely in this task of interpretation that the assistance
offered by the folklore of Modern Greece should be sought. It
should be remembered that there is still living a people who, as
they have inherited the land and the language, may also have
inherited the beliefs and customs, of those ancients whose mazes
of religion are bewildering without a guide who knows them.
Among that still living people it is possible not only to observe
acts and usages, but to enquire also their significance: and though
some customs will undoubtedly be found either to be mere survivals
of which the meaning has long been forgotten, or even to
have been subjected to new and false interpretations, yet others,
still rooted in and nourished by an intelligent belief, may be vital
documents of ancient Greek life and thought.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 2. <span class="smcap">The survival of Ancient Tradition.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There may perhaps be some few who, quite apart from the
continuity of the Hellenic race, a question with which I must
deal later, would be inclined to pronounce the quest of ancient
religion in modern folklore mere lost labour. The lapse, they
may think, of all the centuries which separate the present day
from the age of Hellenic greatness would in itself disfigure or
altogether efface any tradition of genuine value. Such a view,
however, is opposed to all the lessons that have of late years been
gained from a more systematic study of the folklore of all parts
of the world. Certain principles of magic and certain tendencies
of superstition seem to obtain, in curiously similar form, among
peoples far removed both in racial type and in geographical
position. It is sometimes urged by way of explanation that the
resources of the primitive mind are necessarily so limited, that
many coincidences in belief and custom are only to be expected,
and that therefore the similarity of form presented by some superstitions
of widely separated peoples is no argument in favour of
their common origin. But, for my part, when I consider such a
belief as that in the Evil Eye, which possesses, I believe, an
almost world-wide notoriety, I find it more reasonable to suppose
that it was a tenet in the creed of some single primitive people,
of whom many present races of the world are offshoots, and from
whom they have inherited the superstition, than that scores or
hundreds of peoples, who had long since diverged in racial type
and dwelling and language, should subsequently have hit upon
one uniform belief. Indeed it may be that in the future the
study of folklore will become a science of no less value than the
study of language, and that by a comparison of the superstitions
still held by various sections of the human race it will be possible
to adumbrate the beliefs of their remotest common ancestors as
clearly as, by a comparison of their various speeches, the outlines
of a common ancestral language have been, and are being, traced.
The <i>data</i> of folklore are in the nature of things more difficult to
collect, more comprehensive in scope, and more liable to misinterpretation,
than the <i>data</i> of linguistic study; but none the less,
when once there are labourers enough in the field, it is not beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
hope that the laws which govern the tradition and modification of
customs and beliefs may be found to be hardly less definite than
the laws of language.</p>

<p>But comparative folklore is outside my present purpose. I
assume only, without much fear of contradiction, that many of
the popular superstitions and customs and magical practices still
prevalent in the world date from a period far more remote than
any age on which Greek history or archaeology can throw even
a glimmering of light. If then I can show that among the Greek
folk of to-day there still survive in full vigour such examples of
primaeval superstition as the belief in ‘the evil eye’ and the
practice of magic, I shall have established at least an antecedent
probability that there may exist also vestiges of the religious
beliefs and practices of the historical era.</p>

<p>The fear of ‘the evil eye’ (<span class="greek">τὸ κακὸ μάτι</span>, or simply <span class="greek">τὸ μάτι</span><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,) is
universal among the Greek peasantry, and fairly common though
not so frankly avowed among the more educated classes. The old
words <span class="greek">βασκαίνω</span> and <span class="greek">βασκανία</span> are still in use, but <span class="greek">ματιάζω</span> and
<span class="greek">μάτι̯αγμα</span><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, direct formations from the word <span class="greek">μάτι</span>, are more frequently
heard. It would be difficult to say on what grounds this
power of ‘overlooking,’ if I may use a popular English equivalent,
is usually imputed to anyone. Old women are most generally
credited with it, but not so much owing to any menacing appearance
as because they are the chief exponents of witchcraft and it
is only fitting that the wise woman of a village should possess the
power of exercising the evil eye at will. These form therefore
quite a distinct class from those persons whose eyes are suspected
of exerting naturally and involuntarily a baneful influence. In
the neighbourhood of Mount Hymettus it appears that blue eyes
fall most commonly under suspicion: and this is the more curious
because in Attica, with its large proportion of Albanian inhabitants,
blue eyes are by no means rare. Possibly, however, it was
the native Greeks’ suspicion of the strangers who settled among
them, which first caused this particular development of the belief
in this district. Myself possessing eyes of the objectionable colour,
I have more than once been somewhat taken aback at having my
ordinary salutation (<span class="greek">’γει̯ά σου</span>, ‘health to you,’) to some passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
peasant answered only by the sign of the Cross. Fortunately in
other localities I never to my knowledge inspired the same dread;
had it been general, I should have been forced to abandon my
project of enquiring into Greek folklore; for the risk of being
‘overlooked’ holds the Greek peasant, save for a few phrases of
aversion, in awe-stricken silence. My impression is that any eyes
which are peculiar in any way are apt to incur suspicion, and that
in different localities different qualities, colouring or brilliance or
prominence, excite special notice and, with notice, disfavour. The
evil eye, it would seem, is a regular attribute both of the Gorgon
and of the wolf; for both, by merely looking upon a man, are still
believed to inflict some grievous suffering,&mdash;dumbness, madness,
or death; and yet there is little in common between the narrow,
crafty eye of the wolf and either the prominent, glaring eyes in
an ancient Medusa’s head or the passionate, seductive eyes of the
modern Gorgon, unless it be that any fixed unflinching gaze is
sufficient reason for alarm.</p>

<p>Some such explanation will best account for the strange vagary
of superstition which brings under the category of the evil eye
two classes of things which seemingly would have no connexion
either with it or with each other, looking-glasses and the stars.</p>

<p>To look at oneself in a mirror is, in some districts, regarded as
a dangerous operation, especially if it be prolonged. A bride,
being specially liable to all sinister influences, is wise to forego
the pleasure of seeing her own reflection in the glass; and a
woman in child-bed, who is no less liable, is deprived of all
chance of seeing herself by the removal of all mirrors from the
room. The risk in all cases is usually greatest at night, and in
the town of Sinasos in Cappadocia no prudent person would at
that time incur it<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. The reflection, it would seem, of a man’s own
image may put the evil eye upon him by its steady gaze: and it
was in fear of such an issue that Damoetas, in the <i>Idylls</i> of Theocritus,
after criticizing his own features reflected in some glassy
pool, spat thrice into his bosom that he might not suffer from the
evil eye<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>The belief in a certain magical property of the stars akin to
that of the evil eye is far more widely held. They are, as it were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the eyes of night, and in the darkness ‘overlook’ men and their
belongings as disastrously as does the human eye in the day-time.
Just as a woman after confinement is peculiarly liable to the
evil eye and must have amulets hung about her and mirrors
removed from her room, so must particular care be taken to
avoid exposure to stellar influence. Sonnini de Magnoncourt, who
had some medical experience in Greece, speaks authoritatively on
this subject. According to the popular view, he says, she must
not let herself be ‘seen by a star’; and if she goes out before the
prescribed time,&mdash;according to this authority, only eight days, but
now preferably forty days, from the birth of the child,&mdash;she is careful
to return home and to shut herself up in her room by sunset,
and after that hour to open neither door nor window, for fear that
a star may surprise her and cause the death of both mother and
child<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. So too in the island of Chios, if there is occasion to carry
leaven from one house to another, it must be covered up,&mdash;in the
day-time ‘to prevent it from being seen by any strange eye,’
at night ‘to prevent it from being seen by the stars’: for if
it were ‘overlooked’ by either, the bread made with it would
not rise<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Such customs show clearly that the stars are held to
exercise exactly the same malign influence as the human eye:
the same simple phrases denote in Greek the operation of either,
and the ‘overlooking’ of either has the same blighting effect.</p>

<p>The range of this mischievous influence&mdash;for I now take it
that the evil eye and the stars are indistinguishable in their
ill effects&mdash;is very large. Human beings are perhaps most susceptible
to it. In some districts<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> indeed new-born infants up to
the time of their baptism are held to be immune; till then they
are the children of darkness, and the powers of darkness do not
move against them. But in general no one at any moment of his
life is wholly secure. Amulets however afford a reasonable safety
at ordinary times; it is chiefly in the critical hours of life, at
marriage and at the birth of children, that the fear of the evil eye is
lively and the precautions against it more elaborate. Animals also
may be affected. Horses and mules are very commonly protected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
by amulets hung round their necks, and this is the original purpose
of the strings of blue beads with which the cab-horses of Athens
are often decorated. The shepherd too has cause for anxiety on
behalf of his flock, and, when a bad season or disease diminishes
the number of his lambs, is apt to re-echo the pastoral complaint,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Some jealous eye “o’erlooks” my tender lambs.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the pernicious influence makes itself felt in even a lower scale
of life. In the neighbourhood of Sparta, where there is a considerable
silk industry, the women believe that silk-worms are
susceptible of mischief from the evil eye; and the same superstition
is recorded by de Magnoncourt from Chios.</p>

<p>Of inanimate things, those most easily damaged in a similar
way are leaven, salt, and vinegar,&mdash;as being possessed of quickening
or preservative properties to which the blighting, destructive power
of the evil eye or of the stars is naturally opposed. The precautions
to be observed in carrying leaven from house to house have already
been noticed. Equal care is required in the making of the bread.
It often happens, so I have been told, that when a woman is
kneading, some malicious neighbour will come in, ostensibly for
a chat, and put the evil eye upon the leaven; and unless the
woman perceives what is going on and averts disaster by a special
gesture which turns the evil influence against the intruder,
nothing to call bread will be baked that day. Similarly it is
unwise to borrow or to give away either salt or vinegar at night<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>;
but if it is necessary, it is prudent to take precautions to prevent
its exposure to the stars, which may even be cheated of their
prey by some such device as calling the vinegar (<span class="greek">ξεῖδι</span>) ‘syrup’
(<span class="greek">γλυκάδι</span>) in asking for it<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Further, an object which has been
exposed to the stars may even carry the infection, as it were, to
those who afterwards use it. For this reason the linen and
clothes of a mother and her new-born infant must never be left
out of doors at night<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>The precaution, as I have said, most commonly adopted is the
wearing of amulets. The articles which have the greatest intrinsic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
virtue for this purpose are garlic, bits of blue stone or glass often
in the form of beads, old coins, salt, and charcoal: but many other
things, by their associations, may be rendered efficacious. The
stump of a candle burnt on some high religious festival, or a
shred of the Holy Shroud used on Good Friday, is by no means
to be despised; and the bones of a bat or a snake’s skin over
which a witch has muttered her incantations acquire thereby
an equal merit. But such charms as these are <i>objets de luxe</i>; the
ordinary man contents himself with the commoner articles whose
virtue is in themselves. No midwife, I understand, would go
about her business without a plentiful supply of garlic. It is well
that the room should be redolent of it, and a few cloves must be
fastened about the baby’s neck either at birth or immediately
after the baptism. Blue beads are in general use for women,
children, and animals. If men wear them, they are usually concealed
from view. But mothers value them above all, because
in virtue of their colour&mdash;<span class="greek">γαλάζιος</span> is modern Greek for ‘blue’&mdash;they
ensure an abundant supply of milk (<span class="greek">γάλα</span>) unaffected by the
evil eye or any other sinister potency. Salt and charcoal are most
conveniently carried in little bags with a string to go round the
neck. An effective charm consists of three grains of each material
with an old coin. But many other things are also used; when I
have been permitted to inspect the contents of such a bag, I have
found strange assortments of things, pebbles, pomegranate-seeds,
bits of soap, leaves of basil and other plants, often hard to recognize
through age and dirt and grease. One scientifically-minded
man recommended me sulphate of copper.</p>

<p>Special occasions also have special precautions proper to them.
At a wedding, the time of all others when envious eyes are most
likely to cause mischief, the bridegroom commonly carries a black-handled
knife slipped inside his belt<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, and the bride has an open
pair of scissors in her shoe or some convenient place, in order that
any such evil influence may be ‘cut off.’ But some of these
magical safeguards concern not only the evil eye, but ghostly
perils in general, and will claim notice in other connexions.</p>

<p>If, however, through lack of precautions or in spite of them,
a man suspects that he is being ‘overlooked,’ he must rely for
protection on the resources with which nature has provided him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
The simplest thing is to spit,&mdash;three times for choice, for that
number has magical value,&mdash;but on oneself, not at the suspected
foe. Theocritus was scrupulously correct, according to the modern
view, in making his shepherd spit thrice on his own bosom.
Another expedient, though no garlic be at hand to give effect
to the words, is to ejaculate, <span class="greek">σκόρδο ’στὰ μάτι̯α σου</span>, ‘garlic in
your eyes!’ Or use may be made of an imprecation considered
effective in many circumstances of danger, <span class="greek">νὰ φᾶς τὸ κεφάλι σου</span>,
‘may you devour your own head!’ Lastly there is the <span class="greek">φάσκελον</span>,
a gesture of the hand,&mdash;first raised with the fist closed and then
suddenly advanced either with all the fingers open but bent, or
with the thumb and little finger alone extended,&mdash;which returns
the evil upon the offender’s own head with usury.</p>

<p>But, in spite of these manifold means of defence, the evil eye
has its victims; some malady seizes upon a man, for which no
other cause can be assigned; and the question of a cure arises.
Here the Church comes to the rescue, with special forms of
prayer, commonly known as <span class="greek">βασκανισμοί</span>, provided for the purpose.
The person affected goes to the church, or, if the case be
serious, the priest comes to his house, the prayers are recited,
and the sufferer is fumigated with incense. Also if there happens
to be a sacred spring or well, <span class="greek">ἅγι̯ασμα</span> as it is called, in the
precincts of any church near,&mdash;and there are a fair number of
churches in Greece which derive both fame and emolument from
the possession of healing and miracle-working waters<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,&mdash;the victim
of the evil eye is well-advised to drink of them. There are some,
however, who rate the powers of a witch more highly than those
of a priest, and prefer her incantations to the prayers of the
Church. She knows, or is ready to improvise, forms of exorcism
(<span class="greek">ξόρκια</span>, <span class="greek">ξορκισμοί</span>) for all kinds of affliction. A typical example<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
begins, as do many of the incantations of witchcraft, with an
invocation of Christ and the Virgin and the Trinity and the
twelve Apostles; then comes a complaint against the grievous
illness which needs curing; next imprecations upon the man or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
woman responsible for causing it; and finally an adjuration of
the evil eye to depart from the sufferer’s ‘head and heart and
finger-nails and toe-nails and the cockles of the heart, and to
begone to the hills and mountains<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>’ and so forth; after all which
the Lord’s prayer or any religious formula may be repeated <i>ad
libitum</i>. During the recitation of some such charm, the witch
fumigates her patient either with incense, or,&mdash;what is more
effectual where a guess can be made as to the identity of the
envious enemy,&mdash;by burning something belonging to the latter,
a piece of his clothing or even a handful of earth from his
doorway<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Or again, if the patient is at a loss to conjecture who
it is that has harmed him, recourse may be had to divination.
A familiar method is to burn leaves or petals of certain plants,&mdash;basil
and gillyflower being of special repute<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>,&mdash;mentioning at the
same time a number of names in succession. A loud pop or
crackling denotes that the name of the offender has been reached,
and the treatment can then proceed as described above.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No less widespread in Greece than the belief in the evil eye,
and equally primitive in character, is the practice of magic. Few
villages, I believe, even at the present day do not possess a wise
woman (<span class="greek">μάγισσα</span>). Often indeed, owing to the spread of education
and the desire to be thought ‘European’ and ‘civilised,’ the inhabitants
will indignantly deny her existence, and affect to speak
of witches as things of the past. But in times of illness or
trouble they are apt to forget their pretensions of superiority,
and do not hesitate to avail themselves of the lore inherited
from their superstitious forefathers. For the most part women
are the depositaries of these ancient secrets, and the knowledge
of charms, incantations, and all the rites and formularies of witchcraft
is handed down from mother to daughter. But men are
not excluded from the profession. The functions of the priest,
for example, are not clearly distinguished from those of the unconsecrated
magician. At a baptism, which often takes place in
the house where the child is born and not at the church, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
priest opens the service by exorcising all evil spirits and influences
from the four corners of the room by swinging his censer,
but the midwife, who usually knows something of magic, or one
of the god-parents, accompanies him and makes assurance doubly
sure by spitting in each suspected nook. Moreover if a priest
lead a notoriously evil life or chance to be actually unfrocked,
the devil invests him with a double portion of magical power,
which on any serious occasion is sure to be in request. But,
apart from the clergy who owe their powers to the use or abuse
of their office, there are other men too here and there who deal
in witchcraft. They are usually specialists in some one branch,
and professors of the white art rather than of the black,&mdash;one
versed in popular medicine and the incantations proper to it,
another in undoing mischievous spells, another in laying the
restless dead. The general practitioners, causing disease as often
as curing it, binding with curses as readily as loosing from them,
are for the most part women.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to enumerate here all the petty uses of
magic of which I have heard or read: indeed an exhaustive
treatment of the subject, even for one who had devoted a lifetime
to cultivating an intimacy with Greek witches, would be
hardly possible; for their secrets are not lightly divulged, and
new circumstances may at any time require the invention of new
methods. I propose only to describe some of the best known and
most widely spread practices, some beneficent, others mischievous.
Most of them will be seen to be based on the primitive and
worldwide principle of sympathetic magic,&mdash;the principle that a
relation, analogy, or sympathy existing, or being once established,
between two objects, that which the one does or suffers, will be
done or suffered also by the other.</p>

<p>If it be desired to cause physical injury or death to an
enemy, the simplest and surest method is to make an image of
him in some malleable material,&mdash;wax, lead, or clay,&mdash;and, if
opportunity offer, to knead into it or attach to it some trifle
from the enemy’s person. Three hairs from his head are a highly
valuable acquisition, but parings of his nails or a few shreds of
his clothing will serve: or again the image may be put in some
place where his shadow will fall upon it as he passes. These
refinements of the practice, however, are not indispensable;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the image by itself will suffice. This being made, the treatment
of it varies according to the degree of suffering which it is
desired to inflict.</p>

<p>Acute pain may be caused to the man by driving into his
image pins or nails. This device is popularly known as <span class="greek">κάρφωμα</span>,
‘pinning’ or ‘nailing,’ and many variations of it are practised.
One case recorded in some detail was that of a priest’s wife who
from her wedding-day onward was a prey to various pains and
ills. The priest tried in vain to relieve them by prayer, and
finally called in a witch to aid him. After performing certain
occult rites of divination, she informed him that he must dig
in the middle of his courtyard. There he found a tin, which
on being opened revealed an assortment of pernicious charms,&mdash;one
of his wife’s bridal shoes with a large nail through it,
a dried-up bit of soap (presumably from the bridal bath) stuck
full of pins, a wisp of hair (probably some of the bride’s combings)
all in a tangle, and lastly a padlock. The nail and pins
were at once pulled out and the hair carefully disentangled, with
the result that the woman was freed from her pains and her
complicated ailments. But the padlock could not be undone,
and was thrown away into the sea, with the result that the
woman remained childless. The bride had been ‘nailed’ (<span class="greek">καρφωμένη</span>)
by a rival. In this case, it is true, no waxen or leaden
image was used, but the principle is the same. The use of an
image is only preferable as allowing the maker of it to select any
part of the body which he wishes to torture.</p>

<p>Another method of dealing with the image is to melt or wear
it away gradually; if it be of wax or lead, it may be seared with
a red-hot poker, or placed bodily in the fire; if it be of clay,
it may be scraped with a knife, or put into some stream which
will gradually wash it away. Accordingly as it is thus wasted
away, slowly or rapidly, so will the person whom it represents
waste and die. This is in principle the same system as that
adopted by Simaetha in the Idyll of Theocritus to win back
the love of Delphis. ‘Even as I melt this wax,’ she cries, ‘with
God’s help, so may the Myndian Delphis by love be straightway
molten<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>’; and she too used in her magic rites a fringe from
Delphis’ cloak, to shred and to cast into the fierce flame.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Only,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
in her case, the incantation turned what might have been a
death-spell into a love-charm.</p>

<p>Love and jealousy are still the passions which most frequently
suggest the use of magic. Occult methods are necessary to the
girl whose modesty prevents her from courting openly the man on
whom her heart is set, and not less so to her who would punish
the faithlessness of a former lover.</p>

<p>The following are some recorded recipes<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> for winning the love
of an apathetic swain.</p>

<p>Obtain some milk from the breasts of a mother and daughter
who are both nursing male infants at the same time, or, in
default of that, from any two women both nursing first-born
male infants; mix it with wheat-flour and leaven, and contrive
that the man eat of it. Repeat therewith the following incantation:
<span class="greek">ὅπως κλαῖνε καὶ λαχταρίζουν τώρα τὰ παιδία ποῦ
τοὺς λείπει τὸ γάλα τους, ἔτσι νὰ λαχταρίσῃ καὶ ὁ τάδε γι̯ὰ
τὴν τάδε</span>, ‘As the infants now cry and throb with desire for the
milk which fails them, so may N. throb with desire for M.’</p>

<p>Take a bat or three young swallows, and roast to cinders on
a fire of sticks gathered by a witch at midnight where cross-roads
meet: at the same time repeat the words, <span class="greek">ὅπως στρηφογυρίζει,
τρέμει, καὶ λαχταρίζει ἡ νυχτερίδα ἔτσι νὰ γυρίζῃ ὁ τάδε,
νὰ τρέμῃ καὶ νὰ λαχταρίζῃ ἡ καρδι̯ά του γι̯ὰ τὴν τάδε</span>, ‘As the
bat writhes, quivers, and throbs, so may N. turn, and his heart
quiver and throb with desire for M.’ The ashes of the bat are
then to be put into the man’s drink.</p>

<p>Take a bat and bury it at cross-roads; burn incense over it
for forty days at midnight; dig it up and grind its spine to
powder. Put the dust in the man’s drink as before.</p>

<p>Such are some of the magic means of winning love; and the
rites, while involving as much cruelty to the bat as was suffered
by the bird of witchcraft, the <span class="greek">ἴυγξ</span>, in the ancient counterpart
of these practices, are at any rate, save for the ashes in the
man’s liquor, innocuous to him. But the weapon of witchcraft
wherewith a jealous woman takes vengeance upon a man who
has forsaken her or who has never returned her affection and
takes to himself another for his bride, is truly diabolical. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
is known as the spell of ‘binding’ (<span class="greek">δέσιμον</span> or <span class="greek">ἀμπόδεμα</span><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>). Its
purpose is to fetter the virility of the husband and so to prevent
the consummation of the marriage. The rite itself is simple.
Either the jealous girl herself or a witch employed by her attends
the wedding, taking with her a piece of thread or string in which
three loops have been loosely made. During the reading of the
gospel or the pronouncement of the blessing, she pulls the ends
of the string, forming thereby three knots in it, and at the same
time mutters the brief incantation, <span class="greek">δένω τὸν τάδε καὶ τὴν τάδε,
καὶ τὸ διάβολο ’στὴ μέση</span>, ‘I bind N. and M. and the Devil betwixt
them.’ The thread is subsequently buried or hidden, and unless
it can be found and either be burnt or have the knots untied,
there is small hope for the man to recover from his impotence.
There is no doubt, I think, that the extreme fear in which this
spell is held has in some cases so worked upon the bridegroom’s
nerves as to render the ‘binding’ actually effective, just as
extreme faith in miraculous <i>icons</i> occasionally effects cures of
nervous maladies<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. Sonnini de Magnoncourt vouches for a case,
known to him personally, in which the effect of this terror continued
for several months, until finally the marriage was dissolved
on the ground of non-consummation, and the man afterwards
married another wife and regained his energy<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. I myself have
more than once been told of similar cases, in which however
divorce was not sought (it is extremely rare in Greece) but the
spell was broken by the finding of the thread or by countervailing
operations of magic. In Aetolia, where this superstition is specially
rife, I knew of a priest, a son of Belial by all accounts, who made
a speciality of loosing these binding-spells. By his direction the
afflicted man and his wife would go at sunset to a lonely chapel
on a mountain-side, taking with them food and a liberal supply
of wine, with which to regale themselves and the priest till midnight.
At that hour they undressed and stood before the priest,
who pronounced over them some form of exorcism and benediction,&mdash;my
informant could not give me the words. They then retired
to rest on some bedding provided by the priest on the chapel-floor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
while he recited more prayers and swung his censer over them.
I was assured that more than one couple in the small town
where I was staying confessed to having obtained release from
the spell by a night thus spent and with the extreme simplicity
of the peasants of that district thought no shame to confess it.
And this is the more easily intelligible, because, as we shall see
later<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, the practice of <span class="greek">ἐγκοίμησις</span>, sleeping in some holy place with
a view to being cured of any ailment, is as familiar to Christians
of to-day as it was to their pagan ancestors.</p>

<p>But pure magic too, no less than these quasi-Christian methods,
may effect the loosing of the bond, even without the discovery of
the knotted thread which is the source of the mischief. In a
recent case on record, a witch, having been consulted by a couple
thus distressed, took them to the sea-shore, bade them undress,
bound them together with a vine-shoot, and caused them to stand
embracing one another in the water until forty waves had beaten
upon them<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. On the significance of the details of this charm no
comment is made by the recorder of it; but they deserve, I think,
some notice. The vine-shoot, like the olive-shoot, is a known
instrument of purification, and is sometimes laid on the bier
beside the dead during the lying-in-state (<span class="greek">πρόθεσις</span>). Salt is
likewise possessed of magical powers to avert all evil influences,&mdash;we
have noticed the use of it in amulets to protect from the evil
eye,&mdash;and the sea is therefore more efficacious than a river for mystic
purposes. Forty is the number of purification; the churching of
women takes place on the fortieth day from the birth, whence the
Greek word for to ‘church’ is <span class="greek">σαραντίζω</span>,&mdash;from <span class="greek">σαράντα</span>, ‘forty.’
Lastly the beating of the waves seems intended to drive out by
physical compulsion the devil or any power of evil by which
husband and wife are kept apart.</p>

<p>In view of this danger it is natural that ample precautions
should be taken at every wedding. During the dressing of the
bride or the bridegroom, it is customary to throw a handful of
salt into a vessel of water, saying, <span class="greek">ὅπως λυώνει τὸ ἁλάτι, ἔτσι νὰ
λυώσουν οἱ ὀχτροί</span> (<span class="greek">ἐχθροί</span>), ‘As the salt dissolves, so may all
enemies dissolve.’ The black-handled knife worn by the bridegroom
in his belt, and the pair of scissors put in the bride’s shoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
or sometimes attached to her girdle, both of which have been
noticed as safeguards against the evil eye, serve also to ‘cut’ this
magic bond of impotence. Sometimes too a pair of scissors and a
piece of fisherman’s net are put in the bridal bed. In Acarnania
and Aetolia, and it may be elsewhere, a still more primitive
custom prevails; both bride and bridegroom wear an old piece
of fishing-net,&mdash;in which therefore resides the virtue of salt
water,&mdash;round the loins next to the body; and from these bits
of netting are afterwards made amulets to be worn by any children
of the marriage. Such customs are likely long to continue among
the simpler folk of modern Greece, who frankly and innocently
wish the bride at her wedding reception ‘seven sons and one
daughter.’</p>

<p>But it is not only for ailments induced by malicious magic
that magical means of cure or aversion are used. The whole of
popular medicine is based upon the knowledge of charms and
incantations. Many simples and drugs are of course known and
employed; but it is still generally believed, as it was in old time,
that ‘there would be no good in the herb without the incantation<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.’
For the most ordinary diseases are credited to supernatural
causes, and there is no ill to which flesh is heir,&mdash;from a
headache to the plague,&mdash;without some demon responsible for it.
A nightmare and the sense of physical oppression which often
accompanies it are not traced to so vulgar a cause as a heavy
supper, but are dignified as the work of a malicious being named
<span class="greek">Βραχνᾶς</span><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, who in the dead of night delights to seat himself on
the chest of some sleeper, and by his weight produces an unpleasant
feeling of congestion. Material for a similar personification
has been found also in the more terrible pestilences by
which Greece has from time to time been visited. It is still
believed among the poorest folk of Athens that in a cleft on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Hill of the Nymphs, undisturbed even by the modern observatory
on its summit, there lives a gruesome sisterhood, a trinity of
she-devils, <span class="greek">Χολέρα</span>, <span class="greek">Βλογι̯ά</span>, and <span class="greek">Πανοῦκλα</span>,&mdash;Cholera, Smallpox,
and Plague.</p>

<p>Granted then that illness in general is the malicious work of
supernatural beings, common reason recommends the employment
of supernatural means to defeat and expel them. Forms of
exorcism have in past times been provided by the Church and
are still in vogue; but here, as in other matters, the functions of
the priest are shared with the witch, and an old woman versed
in the traditional lore of popular medicine is as competent as any
bishop to cast out the devils of sickness. Nor do the popular
incantations differ much in substance from the ecclesiastical.
The witch knows better than to try to cast out devils in the
Devil’s name, and her exorcisms contain invocations of God and
the saints of the same character as those sanctioned by the
Church; only in her accompanying rites and gestures there is
a picturesque variety which is lacking in the swinging of the
priest’s censer.</p>

<p>The details of the rites and the full forms of incantation are
in general extremely difficult to obtain. The witches themselves
are always reticent on such points, and I have known one plead,
by way of excuse for her apparent discourtesy in withholding
information, that the virtue of magic was diminished in proportion
as the knowledge of it was disseminated. One cure, however,&mdash;a
cure for headache&mdash;will sufficiently illustrate the principle on
which the healing art among the common-folk generally proceeds.
This cure is based upon the assumption that the tense and
bruised feeling of a bad headache is due to the presence of some
demon within the skull, and that the room which he occupies
must have been provided by distention of the head,&mdash;which will
therefore measure more in circumference while it aches than when
the demon has been exorcised. This is demonstrated in the course
of the cure. The witch takes a handkerchief and measures with
it the patient’s head. Doubling back the six or eight inches of the
handkerchief that remain over, she puts in the fold three cloves
of garlic, three grains of salt, or some other article of magical
virtue, and ties a knot. Then waving the handkerchief about
the patient’s head, she recites her form of exorcism,&mdash;but usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
in a tone so low and mumbling that the bystanders cannot catch
the words. The exorcism being finished, she again measures the
head, and this time the knot, which marks the previous measurement,
is found to overlap, by two or three inches it may be, the
other end of the kerchief,&mdash;a sure sign that the intruding demon
has been expelled and that the head having returned to its
natural dimensions will no longer ache<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. The exact words of the
incantation which should accompany this rite I could not obtain;
but I make little doubt that in substance they would differ little
from a Macedonian formula recently <span class="lock">published:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘For megrim and headache:</p>

<p>‘Write on a piece of paper:&mdash;God of Abraham, God of Isaac,
God of Jacob, loose the demon of the megrim from the head of
Thy servant. I charge thee, unclean spirit which ever sittest in
the head of man, take thy pain and depart from the head: from
half-head, membrane, and vertebra, from the servant of God,
So-and-so. Stand we fairly, stand we with fear of God. Amen<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.’</p>

<p>In this instance we have the formula but not, it seems, the
rite which should accompany it; for the mere act of committing
the words to paper is hardly likely to be deemed sufficient.
Probably the paper would be laid under the pillow at night, or,
as I have known in other cases, would be burnt, and its ashes
taken as a sedative powder.</p>

<p>The various charms which we have so far considered are
directed towards the hurt or the healing of man: but external
nature is also responsive to magic spells. It is rumoured that
there are still witches who have power to draw down the moon
from the heavens by incantation; but a more useful ceremony,
designed to draw down the clouds upon a parched land, may still
be actually witnessed. The most recent case known to me was
in the April of 1899, when the rite was carried out some few
days, unfortunately, after I had left the district by the people of
Larissa. The custom is known all over the north of Greece&mdash;in
Epirus<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, Thessaly, and Macedonia,&mdash;and also it is said among
some of the Turks, Wallachs, and Servians; to the south of those
regions and in the islands of the Aegean I heard nothing of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
A boy (or sometimes, it is said, a girl<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>) is stripped naked and then
dressed up in wreaths and festoons of leafage, grass, and flowers,
and, escorted by a troop of children of his own age, goes the round
of the neighbourhood. He is known as the <span class="greek">περπερία</span>, and his
companions sing as they go,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>and so forth in such simple strain<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. At each doorway and more
particularly at every spring and well, which it is the special duty
of the Perpería to visit, anyone who will may empty a vessel of
water over the boy, to whom some compensation for his drenching
is usually made in the form of sweetmeats or coppers.</p>

<p>The word <span class="greek">περπερία</span> has been the subject of considerable discussion.
By-forms <span class="greek">περπερίτσα</span>, <span class="greek">περπεροῦνα</span>, and <span class="greek">παππαροῦνα</span> also
occur. The first two are of the nature of diminutives; the last-named
is a corrupt form used only, so far as I know, in one district
of Epirus, and means a ‘garden-poppy.’ The perversion of the
word has in this district (Zagorion) affected the rite itself; for it
is considered necessary for this flower to be used largely in dressing
up the chief actor in the ceremony<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. But the most general,
and, as I think, most correct form is <span class="greek">περπερία</span> (or <span class="greek">περπερεία</span>).
With the ancient word <span class="greek">περπερεία</span>, derived from the Latin <i>perperus</i>
and used in the sense of ‘boasting’ or ‘ostentation,’ it can, I feel,
have no connexion; and I suggest that it stands for <span class="greek">περιπορεία</span>,
with the same abbreviation as in <span class="greek">περπατῶ</span> for <span class="greek">περιπατῶ</span>, ‘walk,’ and
subsequent assimilation of the first two syllables. If my conjecture
is right, the word originally meant nothing more than a ‘procession
round’ the village; next it became confined in usage to a procession
for the particular purpose of procuring rain; and finally,
the words <span class="greek">πορεία</span><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and <span class="greek">πορεύομαι</span> having been lost from popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
speech, it was taken to be the name of the boy who plays the
uncomfortable part of vegetation craving water. And indeed it
would seem likely that the song which forms part of the ceremony
was actually first composed at a time when <span class="greek">περπερία</span> was still
understood in the sense of ‘procession’: for in every recorded
version known to me it would be still possible to interpret the
word in this meaning without detriment to the context.</p>

<p>The rite itself as an example of sympathetic magic requires
no commentary: a simpler application of the principle that like
produces like could not be found.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Other examples of primitive customs and beliefs still prevalent
in Greece might easily be amassed: but I have preferred to select
these few for detailed treatment rather than to glance over a
larger number, in order that they may the more clearly be seen
to belong to certain types of superstition found the whole world
over and therefore presumably dating from prehistoric ages: for if
the population of Greece has proved a good vehicle for the transmission
of superstitions so primaeval, it will surely follow that
there is nothing extravagant in hoping to learn also from their
traditions something of the religion of historic Hellas.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 3. <span class="smcap">The survival of Hellenic Tradition.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There may however be some who, while admitting that mere
lapse of time need not have extinguished ancient Hellenic ideas,
will be disposed to question the likelihood, even the possibility,
of their transmission on racial grounds. The belief in the evil
eye and the practice of sympathetic magic were once, they may
say, the common property of the whole uncivilised world; and
though the inhabitants of modern Greece have inherited these
old superstitions and usages, there is nothing to show from what
ancestry they have received the inheritance. The population, it
may be urged, has changed; the Greeks of to-day are not Hellenes;
their blood has been contaminated by foreign admixture, and with
this admixture may have come external, non-Hellenic traditions;
has not Fallmerayer stoutly maintained that the modern inhabitants
of Greece have practically no claim to the name of Hellenes,
but come of a stock Slavonic in the main, though cross-bred with
the offscourings of many peoples?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>

<p>The historical facts from which Fallmerayer argued are not to
be slighted. It is well established<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that, from the middle of the
sixth century onwards, successive hordes of Slavonic invaders
swept over Greece, driving such of the native population as
escaped destruction into the more mountainous or remote districts;
that in the middle of the eighth century, when the
numbers of the Greek population had been further reduced by the
great pestilence of 746, ‘the whole country,’ to use the exact
phrase of Constantine Porphyrogenitus<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, ‘became Slavonic and
was occupied by foreigners’; that the Slavonic supremacy lasted
at least until the end of the tenth century; that thereafter a
gradual fusion of the remnants of the Greek population with their
conquerors began, but proceeded so slowly that at the beginning
of the thirteenth century the ‘Franks,’ as the warriors of Western
Christendom were popularly called, found Slavonic tribes in Elis
and Laconia quite detached from the rest of the population, acknowledging
indeed the supremacy of the Byzantine government,
but still employing their own language and their own laws; and
finally that the amalgamation of the two races was not complete
even by the middle of the fifteenth century, for the Turks at their
conquest of Greece found several tribes of the Peloponnese,
especially in the neighbourhood of Mount Taygetus, still speaking
a Slavonic tongue.</p>

<p>If then, as is now generally admitted, Fallmerayer’s conclusions
were somewhat exaggerated, it remains none the less an historical
fact that there is a very large admixture of Slavonic blood in the
veins of the present inhabitants of Greece. The truth of this is
moreover enforced by the physical characteristics of the people as
a whole. Travellers conversant alike with Slavs and with modern
Greeks have affirmed to me their impression that there is a close
physical resemblance between the two races; and while I have
not the experience of Slavonic races which would permit me to
judge of this resemblance for myself, it certainly offers the best
explanation of my own observations with regard to the variations
of physical type in different parts of the Greek world. In the
islands of the Aegean and in the promontory of Maina, to which
the Slavs never penetrated, the ancient Hellenic types are far
commoner than in the rest of the Peloponnese or in Northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Greece. Not a little of the charm of Tenos or Myconos or Scyros
lies in the fact that the grand and impassive beauty of the earlier
Greek sculpture may still be seen in the living figures and faces
of men and women: and if anyone would see in the flesh the
burly, black-bearded type idealised in a Heracles, he need but
go to the south of the Peloponnese, and among the Maniotes
he will soon be satisfied: for there he will find not merely an
occasional example, as of reversion to an ancestral type, but a
whole tribe of swarthy, stalwart warriors, whose aspect seems to
justify their claim that in proud, though poverty-stricken, isolation
they have kept their native peninsula free from alien aggression,
and the old Laconian blood still pure in their veins. The ordinary
Greek of the mainland, on the other hand, is usually of a mongrel
and unattractive appearance; and in view of the marked difference
of the type in regions untouched by the Slavs, I cannot but impute
his lack of beauty to his largely Slavonic ancestry.</p>

<p>Yet even in the centre of the Peloponnese where the Slavonic
influence has probably been strongest, the pure Greek type is not
wholly extinct. I remember a young man who acted as ostler
and waiter and in all other capacities at a small <i>khan</i> on the road
from Tripolitza to Sparta, who would not have been despised as
a model by Praxiteles; and elsewhere too, now and again, I have
seen statuesque forms and classic features, less perfect indeed
than his, but yet proclaiming beyond question an Hellenic lineage;
so that I should hesitate to say that in any part of Greece the
population is as purely Slavonic as in Maina or many of the
islands it is purely Greek.</p>

<p>But, as I think, the exact proportion of Slavonic and of
Hellenic blood in the veins of the modern Greeks is not a matter
of supreme importance. Even if their outward appearance were
universally and completely Slavonic, I would still maintain that
they deserve the name of Greeks. Though their lineage were
wholly Slavonic, their nationality, I claim, would still be Hellenic.
For the nationality of a people, like the personality of an individual,
is something which eludes definition but which embraces
the mental and the moral as well as the physical. A man’s
personality is not to be determined by knowledge of his family
and his physiognomy alone; and similarly racial descent and
physical type are not the sole indices of nationality. Even if a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
purely Slavonic ancestry had dowered the inhabitants of Greece
with a purely Slavonic appearance, yet, if their thoughts and
speech and acts were, as they are, Greek, I would still venture to
call them Greek in nationality. <i>Ce n’est que la peau dont l’Ethiope
ne change pas.</i></p>

<p>But the people of modern Greece do not actually present so
extreme a case of acquired nationality. They are partly Greek
in race: and if it should appear that they are wholly Greek in
nationality, the explanation must simply be that the character, no
less than the language, of their Hellenic ancestors was superior
in vitality to that of the Slavs who intermarried with them, and
alone has been transmitted to the modern Greek people.</p>

<p>What, then, is the national character at the present day?</p>

<p>The first feature of it which casual conversation with any
Greek will soon bring into view is that narrow patriotism which
was so remarkable a trait in the Greeks of old time. If he be
asked what is his native land (<span class="greek">πατρίδα</span>), his answer will be, not
Greece nor any of the larger divisions of it, but the particular
town or hamlet in which he happened to be born: and if in later
life he change his place of abode, though he live in his new home
ten or twenty years, he will regard himself and be regarded by the
native-born inhabitants as a foreigner (<span class="greek">ξένος</span>). Or again if a man
obtain work for a short time in another part of the country, or
if a girl marry an inhabitant of a village half a dozen miles from
her own, the departure is mourned with some of those plaintive
songs of exile in which the popular muse delights. Nor are there
lacking historical cases in which this narrow love of country has
produced something more than fond lamentations; the boast of
the Maniotes that they have never acknowledged alien masters is
in the main a true boast, and it was pure patriotism which nerved
them in their long struggle with the Turks for the possession of
their rugged, barren, storm-lashed home. It was patriotism too,
narrow and proud, that both sustained the heroic outlaws of Souli
in their defiance of Ottoman armies, and also,&mdash;because they disdained
alliance with their Greek neighbours,&mdash;contributed to their
final downfall.</p>

<p>But so tenacious and indomitable a courage is in modern, as
it was in ancient, Greece the exception rather than the rule.
The men of Maina and of Souli are comparable to the Spartans:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
but in no period of Greek history has steadfast bravery been
commonly displayed. Yet, in spite of the humiliating experiences
of the late Graeco-Turkish war, the Greek people should not be
judged devoid of courage. But theirs is a courage which comes
of impulse rather than of self-command; a courage which might
prompt a charge as brilliant as that of Marathon, but could not
cheerfully face the hardships of a campaign; a courage which
might turn a slight success into a victory, but could not save
a retreat from becoming a rout.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged also that the rank and file are in
general more admirable than their officers. The bravery of the
men, impulsive and short-lived though it be, is inspired by a real
devotion of themselves to a cause; whereas among the officers
self-seeking and even self-saving are conspicuous faults. Even
the really courageous leaders seldom have a single eye to the
success of their arms. Their plans are marred by petty jealousies.
The same rivalries for the supreme command which embarrassed
the Greeks of old in defending their liberty against Persia, were
repeated in the struggles of the last century to throw off the
Turkish yoke. And if in both cases the Greeks were successful,
in neither was victory due to the unity and harmony of their
leaders, but rather to that passionate hatred of the barbarians
which stirred the people as a whole.</p>

<p>Indeed, not only in war but in all conditions of life, any
personal eminence or distinction has been apt to turn the head
of a Greek. ‘The abundant enjoyment of power or wealth,’ said
the ancients not without knowledge of the national character,
‘begets lawlessness and arrogance’; and in humbler phrase the
modern proverb sums up the same qualities of the race,&mdash;<span class="greek">καλὸς
δοῦλος, κακὸς ἀφέντης</span>, ‘a good servant and a bad master.’ In
all periods of Greek history there have been few men who have
attained to power without abusing it. The honour of being returned
to the Greek Parliament upsets the mental balance of a
large number of deputies. Without any more intimate knowledge
of politics than can be obtained from second-rate newspapers, they
believe themselves called and qualified to lead each his own party,
with the result&mdash;so it is commonly said&mdash;that no government
since the first institution of parliament has ever had an assured
majority in the House, and on an average there have been more
than one dissolution a year. The modern parliament is as un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>stable
an institution as the ancient ecclesia of Athens when there
was no longer a Pericles to control it, and its demagogues are
as numerous.</p>

<p>Even the petty eminence of a village schoolmaster proves to be
too giddy a pinnacle for many. Such an one thinks it necessary
to support his position&mdash;which owing to the Greek love of education
is more highly respected perhaps than in other countries&mdash;by
a pretence of universal knowledge and a pedantry as lamentable
as it is ludicrous. I remember a gentleman who boasted
the title of Professor of Ancient History in the <i>gymnasium</i> or
secondary school of a certain town, who called to me one day
as I was passing a <i>café</i> where he and some of his friends were
sitting, and said that they were having a pleasant little discussion
about the first Triumvirate, and had recalled the names of Cicero
and Caesar, but could not at the moment remember the third
party. Could I help them? I hesitated a moment, and then
resolved to risk it and suggest, what was at least alliterative
if not accurate, the name of Cato. ‘Of course,’ he answered,
‘how these things do slip one’s memory sometimes!’ Yet this
Professor posed as an authority on many subjects outside his own
province of learning, and frequently when I met him would insist
on talking dog-Latin with an Italian pronunciation, a medium in
which I found it difficult to converse.</p>

<p>In this readiness to discourse on any and every subject and
to display attainments in and out of season, he and the class of
which he is typical are the living images of the less respectable
of the ancient Sophists. And in pedantry of language too they
fairly rival their famous prototypes. The movement in favour of
an artificial revival of ancient Greek has already been of long duration,
and has had a detrimental effect upon the modern language.
The vulgar tongue has a melodious charm, while many classical
words, in the modern pronunciation, are extremely harsh and
uncouth. The object of the movement is to secure an uniform
‘pure’ speech, as they call it, approximate to that of Plato or of
Xenophon; and the method adopted is to mix up Homeric and
other words of antiquarian celebrity with literal renderings of
modern French idioms, inserting datives, infinitives, and other
obsolete forms at discretion. To aid in this movement is the
task and the delight of the schoolmasters: and such is their
devotion to this linguistic sophistry, that they are not dismayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
even by the ambiguity arising from the use of ancient forms
indistinguishable in modern speech. The two old words <span class="greek">ἡμέτερος</span>
and <span class="greek">ὑμέτερος</span> have now no difference in sound: yet the schoolmaster
uses them and inculcates the use of them, with the
lamentable result that the children are not taught to distinguish
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> even in speech.</p>

<p>And here again the character of the modern Greek reflects
that of his ancestors. Honesty and truthfulness are not the
national virtues. To lie, or even to steal, is accounted morally
venial and intellectually admirable. It is a proof of superior
mother-wit, than which no quality is more valued in the business
of everyday life. Almost the only things in Greece which have
fixed prices are tobacco, newspapers, and railway-tickets. The
hire of a mule, the cost of a bunch of grapes, the price of meat,
the remuneration for a vote at the elections,&mdash;such matters as
these are the subject of long and vivacious bargaining, and if the
money does not change hands on the spot, the bargain may be
smilingly repudiated and an attempt made, on any pretext which
suggests itself, to extort more. Yet there is a certain charm in
all this; for, if a man get his own price, it is not so much the
amount of his profit which pleases him as his success in winning
it; and if he fail, he takes a smaller sum with perfect good
humour and increased respect for the man who has outwitted
him. Anyone may be honest; but to be <span class="greek">ἔξυπνος</span>, as they say,
shrewd, wide-awake,&mdash;this is Greek and admirable. The contrast
of an Aristides with a Themistocles is the natural expression of
Greek thought. Moral uprightness and mental brilliance are not
to be expected of one and the same man; and for the most part
the Greeks now as in old time praise others for their justice and
pride themselves on their cunning. The acme of cleverness is
touched by him who can both profit by dishonesty and maintain
a reputation for sincerity.</p>

<p>But, while truthfulness and fair dealing are certainly rare,
there is one relation in which the most scrupulous fidelity is
unfailingly shown. The obligations of hospitality are everywhere
sacred. The security and the comfort of the guest are not in
name only but in actual fact the first consideration of his host.
However unscrupulous a Greek may be in his ordinary dealings,
he never, I believe, harbours for one moment the idea of making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
profit out of the stranger who seeks the shelter of his roof. For
hospitality in Greece, it must be remembered, means not the
entertainment of friends and acquaintances who are welcome
for their own sake or from whom a return in kind may be expected,
but real <span class="greek">φιλοξενία</span>, a generous and friendly welcome to a
stranger unknown yesterday and vanished again to-morrow. To
each unbidden chance-comer the door is always open. For lodging
he may chance to have an incense-reeking room where the family
<i>icons</i> hang, or a corner of a cottage-floor barricaded against the
poultry and other inmates; for food, hot viands rich in circumambient
oil, or three-month-old rye-bread softened in a cup of
water; but among rich and poor alike he is certain of the best
which there is to give. Even where there are inns available, the
stranger will constantly find that the first native of the place to
whom he puts the Aristophanic enquiry <span class="greek">ὅπου κόρεις ὀλίγιστοι</span><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;which
inn is of least entomological interest&mdash;will constitute himself
not guide but host and will place the resources of his own
house freely at the service of the chance-found visitor.</p>

<p>The reception accorded by Eumaeus to Odysseus, in its revelation
of human&mdash;and also of canine&mdash;character, differs in no
respect from that which may await any traveller at the present
day. As Odysseus approached the swineherd’s hut, ‘suddenly the
yelping dogs espied him, and with loud barking rushed upon him,
but Odysseus guilefully sat down and let fall his staff from his
hand<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.’ Such is the opening of the scene; and many, I suppose,
must have wondered, as they read it, wherein consisted Odysseus’
guilefulness. A shepherd of Northern Arcadia resolved me that
riddle. I had been attacked on a mountain-path by two or three
of his dogs,&mdash;‘like unto wild beasts<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>,’ as Homer has it,&mdash;and the
combat may have lasted some few minutes when the shepherd
thought fit to intervene. Sheep-dogs are of course valued in
proportion to their ferocity towards any person or animal approaching
the flock, and a taste of blood now and again is said
to keep them on their mettle. Fortunately matters had not
reached that point; but none the less I suggested to the man
that he might have bestirred himself sooner. ‘Oh,’ he replied,
‘if you are really in difficulties, you should sit down’; and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
I showed some surprise, he explained that anyone who is
attacked by sheepdogs has only to sit down and let go his
walking-stick or gun or other offensive weapon, and the dogs,
understanding that a truce has been called, will sit down round
him and maintain, so to speak, a peaceful blockade<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. On subsequent
occasions I tested the shepherd’s counsel, beginning
prudently with one dog only and, as I gained assurance, raising
the number: it is uncomfortable<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> to remain sitting with a bloodthirsty
Molossian hound at one’s back, ready to resume hostilities
if any suspicious movement is made; but I must own that, in
my own fairly wide experience, Greek dogs, as they are <i>sans
peur</i> in combat, are also <i>sans reproche</i> in observing a truce.
The traveller may fare worse than by following the example of
guileful Odysseus.</p>

<p>But if the scene of the encounter be not a mountain-path
but the approach to some cottage, the dogs’ master will, like
Eumaeus, hasten to intervene, ‘chiding them and driving them
this way and that with a shower of stones<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,’&mdash;for the Greek dog
does not heed mere words,&mdash;and again like Eumaeus will assure
his visitor that he himself would have been ‘covered with
shame<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>’ if the dogs had done his guest any hurt. Then he will
conduct his guest into his cottage and bid him take his fill of
bread and wine before he tells whence he is come and how he
has fared<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>: for Greek hospitality spares the guest the fatigue of
talking until he is refreshed. The visitor therefore sits at his
ease, silent and patient, while his host catches and kills such
beast or fowl as he may possess, cuts up the flesh in small pieces,
threads these on a spit, and holds them over the embers of his
fire till they are ready to serve up<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>: similarly, in Homeric fashion,
he mixes wine and water<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; and then, all the preparations being
now complete, he urges his guest to the meal<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the hospitality of to-day, in its details no less than in
its spirit, recalls the hospitality of the Homeric age. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
supreme virtue of the ancient Greek remains the supreme virtue
of the modern, and a familiarity with the manners of the present
day alone might suffice to explain why Paris who stole another
man’s wife was execrable but Admetus who let his own wife die
for him could yet win admiration. The one broke the laws of
hospitality; the other, by hiding his loss and entertaining his
guest, upheld them.</p>

<p>A comparative estimate, such as I have essayed, of the
characters of Greeks of old and Greeks of to-day is perhaps
evidence of a somewhat intangible nature to those who are not
personally intimate with the people: but no foreigner, even
though he were totally ignorant of the modern language, could
chance upon one of the many festivals of the country without
remarking that there, in humbler form, are re-enacted many of
the scenes of ancient days. The <span class="greek">πανηγύρια</span>, as they call these
festivals,&mdash;diminutives, both in name and in form, of the
ancient <span class="greek">πανηγύρεις</span>,&mdash;present the same medley of religion, art,
trading, athletics, and amusement which constituted the
Olympian games. The occasion is most commonly some saint’s-day,
and a church or a sacred spring (<span class="greek">ἅγι̯ασμα</span>) the centre
of the gathering. Art is represented by the contests of local
poets or wits in improvising topical and other verses, and
occasionally there is present one of the old-fashioned rhapsodes,
whose number is fast diminishing, to recite to the accompaniment
of a stringed instrument still called the <span class="greek">κιθάρα</span><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the glorious feats
of some patriot-outlaw (<span class="greek">κλέφτης</span>) in defiance of the Turks. Then
there are the pedlars and hucksters strolling to and fro or seated
at their stalls, and ever crying their wares&mdash;fruit, sausages, confectionery
of strange hues and stranger taste, beads, knives, cheap
<i>icons</i> ranging in subject from likenesses of patron-saints to gaudy
views of hell, and all manner of tin-foil trinkets representing
ships, cattle, and parts of the human body for dedication in the
church. Then in some open space there will be a gathering of
young men, running, wrestling, hurling the stone; yonder others,
and with them the girls, indulge in the favourite recreation of
Greece, those graceful dances, of which the best-known, the <span class="greek">συρτός</span><a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and probably others too, are a legacy from dancers of old time.
It is impossible to be a spectator of such scenes without recognising
that here, in embryonic form, are the festivals of which
the famous gatherings of Olympia and Nemea, Delphi and the
Isthmus, were the full development.</p>

<p>And it may well happen too that the observant onlooker
will descry also the rudiments of ancient drama. Often, as is
natural in so mountainous and rugged a country, the only level
dancing-place which a village possesses is a stone-paved threshing-floor
hewn out of the hill-side. Hither on any festal occasion,
be it a saint’s-day or one of the celebrations which naturally
follow the ingathering of harvest or vintage, the dancers betake
themselves. Here too a small booth or tent, still called <span class="greek">σκηνή</span>,
is often rigged up, to which they can retire for rest or refreshment,
while on the slopes above are ranged the spectators.
The circular threshing-floor is the <i>orchestra</i>, the hill-side provides
its tiers of seats, the dancers, who always sing while they dance,
are the chorus; add only the village musician twanging a sorry
lyre, and in the intervals of dancing an old-fashioned rhapsode
reciting some story of bygone days, or, it may be, two village
wits contending in improvised pleasantries, and the rudiments of
ancient Tragedy or Comedy are complete.</p>

<p>Other illustrations might easily be amassed. On March 1st
the boys of Greece still parade the village-streets with a painted
wooden swallow set on a flower-decked pole, and sing substantially
the same ‘swallow-song’ (<span class="greek">χελιδόνισμα</span>)<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as was sung in old time
in Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. On May 1st the girls make wreaths of flowers and
corn which, like the ancient <span class="greek">εἰρεσιώνη</span>, must be left hanging over
the door of the house till next year’s wreaths take their place.
The fisherman still ties his oar to a single thole with a piece of
rope or a thong of leather, as did the mariners of Homer’s age<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.
The farmer still drives his furrows with an Hesiodic plough.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the survivals which bear witness to the
genuinely Hellenic nationality of the inhabitants of modern
Greece: and last, but not least, there is the language, which,
albeit no index of race, is most cogent evidence of tradition. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the action of thought upon language there corresponds a certain
reaction of language upon thought: it is impossible to speak
a tongue which contains, let us say, the word <span class="greek">νεράϊδα</span> (modern
Greek for a ‘nymph’) without possessing also an idea of the
being whom that word denotes. Therefore even if the whole
population of Greece were demonstrably of Slavonic race, the
fact that it now speaks Greek would go far to support its claim
to Hellenic nationality: for its adoption of the Greek language
would imply its assimilation of Greek thought.</p>

<p>But, quite apart from the evidence of custom and language,
the occasional perpetuation of the ancient Greek physical type
and the general survival of the ancient Greek character plainly
forbid so extreme a supposition as that of Fallmerayer: no
traveller familiar with the modern Greek peasantry could entertain
for a moment the idea that at any period the whole of
Greece became Slavonicized, but, whatever might be the historical
arguments for such a theory, would reject it, on the evidence
of his own eyes, as ludicrously exaggerated. Fusion of race, no
doubt, there has been; but in that fusion the Hellenic element
must have been the most vital and persistent; for if the present
population of Greece is of mixed descent, in its traditions at least
it is almost purely Hellenic.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 4. <span class="smcap">The Survival of Pagan Tradition.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It appears then that notwithstanding the immigration of
Slavonic hordes, and notwithstanding also, it may be added, the
influences exercised in later periods by ‘Franks,’ Genoese, Venetians,
and Turks, the traditions of the inhabitants of Greece still
remain singularly pure; and their claim to Hellenic nationality is
justified by their language, by their character, and by many
secular aspects of their civilisation. But in the domain of religion
it might reasonably be expected that a large change would have
taken place. There is the obstinate fact, it may be thought,
that the Greeks are now and have long been Christian. Did
not the new religion dispossess and oust the ancient polytheism?
Are we to look for pagan customs in the hallowed usages of
the Greek Church? What can the simple Christian peasant of
to-day, subject from his youth up to ecclesiastical influence, know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of the religion of his distant ancestors,&mdash;of those fundamental
beliefs which guided their conduct towards gods and men in
this life, and inspired their care for the dead?</p>

<p>On the conduct of man towards his fellow-men in this life
the influence of Christianity appears to have been as great as
that of paganism was small. Duty towards one’s neighbour
hardly came within the purview of Hellenic religion. If we
look at the supreme acts of worship in ancient times, we cannot
fail to be struck by the disunion of the religious and the ethical.
A certain purity was no doubt required of those who attended
the mysteries of Eleusis; but by that purity was meant physical
cleanliness and, strangely enough, a pure use of the Greek
language, just as much as any moral temperance or rectitude;
and the required condition was largely attained by the use or
avoidance of certain foods and by bathing in the sea. Their
cleanliness in fact was of the same confused kind, half physical
and half moral, as that which the inhabitants of Tenos were
formerly wont, and perhaps still continue, to seek on S. John
the Baptist’s day (June 24) by leaping thrice through a bonfire
and crying ‘Here I leave my sins and my fleas<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>’: and it was
acquired by means equally material. There is nothing conspicuously
ethical in such a purity as this.</p>

<p>If moreover, as has been well argued<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, a state of ecstasy was
the highest manifestation of religious feeling, and this spiritual
exaltation was the deliberate aim and end of Bacchic and other
orgies, it must be frankly avowed that religion in its highest
manifestations was not conducive to what we call morality.
The means of inducing the ecstatic condition comprised drunkenness,
inhalation of vapours, wild and licentious dancing. With
physical surexcitation came, or was intended to come, a spiritual
elevation such that the mind could visualise the object of
its desire<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and worship, and enjoy a sense of unity therewith.
On the savagery and debauchery which accompanied these religious
celebrations there is no need to enlarge. The <i>Bacchae</i> of
Euripides, with all its passion for the beauty of holiness, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
a standing monument to the excesses of frenzy: and that these
were no mere figment of the poet’s imagination nor a transfiguration
of rites long obsolete, is proved by a single sentence of a
sober enough writer of later times, ‘The things that take place at
nocturnal celebrations, however licentious they may be, although
known to the company at large, are to some extent condoned
by them owing to the drunkenness<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.’</p>

<p>There were of course certain sects, such as the Orphic, who,
in strong contrast with the ordinary religion, upheld definite
ethical standards, preaching the necessity of purification from sin,
and advocating moral and even ascetic rules of life. Yet, in spite
of this, we find a certain amalgamation of Orphic and Bacchic
mysteries. And why? Simply because both sects alike had a
single end in view, a spiritual exaltation in which the soul might
transcend the things of ordinary life, and see and commune with
its gods. What did it matter if the means to that end differed?
The one sect might reduce the passions of the body by rigid
abstinence; the other might deaden them with a surfeit of their
desire; but, whether by prostration or by surexcitation, the same
religious end was sought and gained, and that end justified
means which we count immoral.</p>

<p>In effect the morality of a man’s life counted for nothing as
compared with his religion. Participation in the mysteries ensured
blessings here and hereafter which an evil life would not forfeit
nor a good life, without initiation, earn. ‘Thrice blessed they
of men, who look upon these rites ere they go to Hades’ home:
for them alone is there true life there, and for the others
nought but evil<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.’ It was this that made Diogenes scoffingly ask,
‘What, shall the thief Pataecion have a better lot than Epaminondas
after death, because he has been initiated<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>?’ Seemingly
religion and morality were to the Greek mind divorced, or
rather had never been wedded. Religion was concerned only
with the intercourse of man and god: the moral character of
the man himself and his relations with his fellows were outside
the religious sphere.</p>

<p>Indeed it would have been hard for the ancients to regard
morality as a religious obligation, when immorality was freely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
imputed to their gods. This was a real obstacle to the ethical
improvement of the people at large, and was recognised as such
by many thinkers. Pindar strove to expurgate mythological
stories which brought discredit on the morals of Olympus. Plato
would have banished the evil records of Homeric theology from
his ideal state, and ridicules Musaeus for forming no more lofty
conception of future bliss than ‘eternal drunkenness.’ Epicurus
defended his own attitude towards the gods on the plea that
there was ‘no impiety in doing away with the popular gods, but
rather in attaching to the gods the popular ideas of them<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.’
In effect, in order to reconcile religion with the teaching of
ethics, the would-be preacher of morality had either openly to
discard a large amount of the popular theology or else to
have recourse to adaptation and mystical interpretation of so
artificial and arbitrary a kind that it could gain no hold upon
the simple and spontaneous beliefs of the common-folk. Yet
even among the ordinary men of those days there must have
been some who, though they did not aspire to instruct their
fellow-men, yet in hours of sober reason and cool judgement
cannot have viewed unabashed the inconsistencies of a religion
whose gods were stained with human vices. But such thoughts,
we may suppose, were swept away, as men approached their
sanctuaries and their mysteries, by a flood of religious fervour.
Passion in such moments defeated reason. Emotion, susceptibility,
imagination, impetuosity, powers of visualisation regarded
among western nations as the perquisite of the inebriate, powers
of ecstasy not easily distinguished from hysteria,&mdash;such were the
mental conditions essential to the highest acts of worship; by
these, and not by sober meditation, the soul attained to the
closest communing and fullest union with that god whose glory
for the nonce outshone all pale remembrance of mere moral
rectitude and alone was able to evoke every supreme emotion of
his worshipper.</p>

<p>If then morality was ever to be imposed and sanctioned by
religion, a wholly new religion had to be found. This was the
opportunity of Christianity. Paganism, in some of its most sacred
rites, had availed itself even of immoral means to secure a
religious end: Christianity gave to ethics a new and higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
status, and was rather in danger of making religion wholly subservient
to morality. That it was difficult to bring the first
converts to the new point of view, is evident from the rebukes
administered by S. Paul to the Corinthians, who seem not
only to have indulged in many gross forms of vice in everyday
life, but even to have made the most sacred of Christian services
an occasion for gluttony and drunkenness<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>In all then that concerns the ethical standards of the people,
our study of modern Greece will contribute little to the understanding
of ancient thought or conduct. Christianity has fenced
men about with a rigid moral code, and has exerted itself to
punish those who break bounds. Duty towards man is now
recognised as the complement of duty towards God; and any one
who by a notoriously evil life has outraged the moral laws of
conduct, is liable to be deprived by excommunication of the
established means of worship. The frailties of the Greek character
remain indeed such as they always were: but now religion at
least enjoins, if it cannot always enforce, the observance of a moral
code which includes the eighth commandment, and Pataecion,
though he go regularly to church, yet lacks something.</p>

<p>But while the Church had an open field in matters of morality
and had no system of ethics based on Hellenic religion to
combat in introducing her higher views of man’s duty towards
his fellow-men, in the province of pure religion and of all that
concerns the relations of man with his God or gods she necessarily
encountered competition and opposition. Primarily the
contest between paganism and Christianity might have been
expected to resolve itself into a struggle between polytheism
and monotheism: but as a matter of fact that simple issue became
considerably complicated.</p>

<p>The minds of the educated classes had become confused by the
subtleties of the Gnostics, who sought to find, in some philosophical
basis common to all religions, an intellectual justification
for accepting Christianity without wholly discarding earlier religious
convictions. This however was a matter of theology
rather than of religion, appealing not to the heart but to the
head: and so far as the common-folk were concerned we may
safely say that such speculations were above their heads.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>
<p>Yet for them too the issue was confused in two ways. The
first disturbing factor was the attitude adopted by each of the
two parties, pagan and Christian, towards the object of the
other’s worship. The pagans&mdash;so catholic are the sympathies
of polytheism&mdash;were ready enough to welcome Christ into the
number of their gods. Tertullian tells us that the emperor
Tiberius proposed the apotheosis of Christ<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. Hadrian is said to
have built temples in his honour<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Alexander Severus had in his
private chapel statues of Christ, Abraham, and Orpheus<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; and
a similar association of Homer, Pythagoras, Christ, and S. Paul
is noted by S. Augustine<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Since then there is no reason for
supposing that the common-folk were more exclusive in their
religious sympathies than the upper classes, it may safely be
inferred that the average Pagan was willing to admit Christ to a
place among the gods of Greece. The Christians on the other hand
did not attack paganism by an utter denial of the existence of the
old gods. They sought rather to ridicule and discredit them by
pointing out the inconsistencies of pagan theology, and by ransacking
mythology for every tale of the vices and misdoings of its
deities. They even appealed to the testimony of Homer himself
to show that the so-called gods (<span class="greek">θεοί</span>) of the Greek folk were
mere demons (<span class="greek">δαίμονες</span>)<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>,&mdash;for since Homer’s day the latter word
had lost caste. Such methods, had they been wholly successful,
might have produced similar results to those which followed
the conflict of two religions in the early ages of Greece. As
the Titanic dynasty of gods had fallen before the Olympian Zeus,
and in their defeat had come to be accounted cruel and malicious
powers rightly ousted from heaven by a more just and gracious
deity, so too in turn might the whole number of the pagan gods
have been reduced to the status of devils to act as a foil to the
goodness of the Christian God. But this did not happen. One
reason perhaps was that Christianity came provided with its own
devil or devils, and the pagans were naturally averse from placing
the gods whom they had been wont to venerate in the same
category with spirits so uncompromisingly evil. The main reason
however must be found in the fact that the Church had nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
to offer to the pagans in exchange for the countless gods of the
old religion whom she was endeavouring to displace and to
degrade. Indeed the real difficulty of the Christian Church was
the tolerant spirit of the Greek people. They would not acknowledge
that any feud existed. They were ready to worship the
Christian God: but they must have felt that it was unreasonable
of the Christian missionaries to ask them to give up all their old
gods merely because a new god had been introduced. Even if their
gods were all that the Christians represented them to be&mdash;cruel,
licentious, unjust&mdash;that was no reason for neglecting them; rather
it furnished a stronger motive for propitiating them and averting
their wrath by prayer and sacrifice. Tolerant themselves, they
must have resented a little the intolerance of the new religion.</p>

<p>Such being the attitude of the two parties, it may be doubted
whether the Church would have made much headway in Greece,
had it not been for a fresh development in her own conditions.
And this development was the second disturbing factor in what
should have been the simple struggle between monotheism and
polytheism. Christianity, as understood by the masses, became
polytheistic on its own account.</p>

<p>It is true that the authorities of the Greek Church have
always taught that the angels and saints are not to be worshipped
in the same sense as God. Ecclesiastical doctrine concedes to
them no power to grant the petitions of men at their own will:
they can act as intermediaries only between man and the
Almighty; yet while they cannot in their own might fulfil the
requests which they hear, their intervention as messengers to
the throne of God is deemed to enhance the value of man’s
prayers and wellnigh to ensure their acceptance. But such a
doctrine is naturally too subtle for the uninstructed common-folk:
and just as Christ had been admitted to the ranks of the Greek
gods, so were the saints, it would seem, accepted as lesser deities
or perhaps heroes. Whatever their precise status may have been,
they at any rate became objects of worship; and a religion which
admits many objects of worship becomes necessarily a form of
polytheism.</p>

<p>Now while the Church did not sanction this state of things
by her doctrine, there can be no doubt that she condoned it by
the use to which she put it. The attempt to crush paganism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
had so far failed, and there was no longer any thought of
a combat <i>à outrance</i> between the two religions. Violence was
to give way to diplomacy; and the chief instrument of the
Church’s diplomacy was the worship of the saints. It became
her hope to supplant paganism by substituting for the old gods
Christian saints of similar names and functions; and the effects
of this policy are everywhere in evidence in modern Greece.</p>

<p>Thus Dionysus was displaced by S. Dionysius, as a story still
current in Greece testifies. ‘Once upon a time S. Dionysius was
on his way to Naxos: and as he went he espied a small plant
which excited his wonder. He dug it up, and because the sun
was hot sought wherewith to shelter it. As he looked about, he
saw the bone of a bird’s leg, and in this he put the plant to keep
it safe. To his surprise the plant began to grow, and he sought
again a larger covering for it. This time he found the leg-bone
of a lion, and as he could not detach the plant from the bird’s
leg, he put both together in that of the lion. Yet again it grew
and this time he found the leg-bone of an ass and put plant and
all into that. And so he came to Naxos. And when he came
to plant the vine&mdash;for the plant was in fact the first vine&mdash;he
could not sever it from the bones that sheltered it, but planted
them all together. Then the vine grew and bore grapes and men
made wine and drank thereof. And first when they drank they
sang like birds, and when they drank more they grew strong as
lions, and afterwards foolish as asses<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.’</p>

<p>The disguise of the ancient god is thin indeed. His name is
changed by an iota, but his character not a jot. S. Dionysius
is god of the vine, and even retains his predecessor’s connexion
with Naxos. It is perhaps noteworthy too that in Athens the
road which skirts the south side of the Acropolis and the theatre
of Dionysus is now called the street of S. Dionysius the Areopagite.
I was once corrected by a Greek of average education
for speaking of the theatre of Dionysus instead of ascribing it
to his saintly namesake.</p>

<p>Demeter again, although as we shall see later she still survives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
as a distinct personality, has been for the most part dispossessed
by S. Demetrius. His festival, which falls in October and is
therefore remote from harvest-time, is none the less celebrated
with special enthusiasm among the agricultural classes; marriages
too are especially frequent on that day<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly Artemis, though she too is still known to the common-folk
in some districts, has in the main handed over her
functions to a saint of the other sex, Artemidos. Theodore Bent
has recorded a good instance of this from the island of Keos
(modern Zea). There is a belief throughout Greece that weakly
children who show signs of wasting have been ‘struck by the
Nereids,’&mdash;by nymphs, that is, of any kind, whether terrestrial or
marine. ‘In Keos,’ says Bent, ‘S. Artemidos is the patron of these
weaklings, and the church dedicated to him is some little way from
the town on the hill-slopes; thither a mother will take a child
afflicted by any mysterious wasting, “struck by the Nereids,” as
they say. She then strips off its clothes and puts on new ones,
blessed by the priest, leaving the old ones as a perquisite to the
Church; and then if perchance the child grows strong, she will
thank S. Artemidos for the blessing he has vouchsafed, unconscious
that by so doing she is perpetuating the archaic worship of Artemis,
to whom in classical times were attached the epithets <span class="greek">παιδοτρόφος</span>,
<span class="greek">κουροτρόφος</span>, <span class="greek">φιλομείραξ</span>; and now the Ionian idea of the
fructifying and nourishing properties of the Ephesian Artemis
has been transferred to her Christian namesake<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.’ It might
have been added that in this custom are reflected not only those
general attributes of the tendance of children which Artemis
shared with many other deities, but possibly also her power to
undo any mischief wrought by her handmaidens, the nymphs<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p>Again there is every reason to suppose that S. Elias<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> whose
chapels crown countless hilltops is merely the Christian successor
to Helios, the Sun. The two names, which have only a moderate
resemblance in the nominative, coincide for modern pronunciation
in the genitive; and the frequency with which that case was
needed in speaking of the church or the mountain-peak dedicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
to one or the other may have facilitated the transition. Besides
inheriting the mountain sanctuaries at which the worship of the
Sun may have persisted from a very early age, S. Elias has also
taken over the chariot of his predecessor, and thunder is sometimes
attributed to the rolling of its wheels.</p>

<p>In other cases, without any resemblance of names, identity of
attributes or functions suggested the substitution of saint for
pagan deity. Hermes who in old times was the chief ‘angel’ or
messenger of the immortals (<span class="greek">ἄγγελος ἀθανάτων</span>) was naturally
succeeded by the archangel Michael, upon whom therefore devolves
the duty of escorting men’s souls to Hades; and to this
day the men of Maina tell how the archangel, with drawn sword
in his hand instead of the wand of his prototype, may be seen
passing to and fro at the mouth of the caves of Taenarus through
which Heracles made his ascent with Cerberus from the lower
world, and which is still the best-known descent thereto. The
supplanting of Hermes by Michael is well illustrated in the
sphere of art also by a curious gem. The design is an ordinary
type of Hermes with his traditional cap, and at his side a cock,
the symbol of vigilance and of gymnastic sport; by a later
hand has been engraved the name ‘Michael’; the cock remained
to be interpreted doubtless as the Christian symbol of the awakening
at the last day of them that sleep<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>The conversion of pagan temples or of their sites to the purposes
of Christianity tells the same tale. The virgin goddess of Athens
ceded the Parthenon to the Blessed Virgin of the Christians. The
so-called Theseum, whether Theseus or Heracles was its original
occupant, was fitly made over to the warrior S. George: but
none the less what seems to have been an old pagan festival,
known as the <span class="greek">ρουσάλια</span> (Latin <i>rosalia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, continues to this day to
be celebrated with dancing and feasting in its precincts. The
Church of the Annunciation at Tenos, so famous throughout the
Greek world for its miracles of healing, stands on the foundations
of Poseidon’s ancient sanctuary, and includes in its precincts a
holy spring (<span class="greek">ἅγι̯ασμα</span>) whose healing virtues, we can hardly doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
were first discovered by the pagans: for Poseidon was worshipped
in Tenos under the title of the ‘healer’ (<span class="greek">ἰατρός</span>)<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Indeed throughout
the length and breadth of the land the traveller will find
churches built with the material of the old temples or superimposed
upon their foundation, and cannot fail to detect therein
evidence of a deliberate policy on the part of the Church.</p>

<p>But in her attempts to be conciliatory she became in fact
compromised. It was politic no doubt to encourage the weaker
brethren by building churches on sites where they had long been
wont to worship: it was politic to smooth the path of the common-folk
by substituting for the god whom they had worshipped a
patron-saint of like name or attributes. But in so doing the
Church practically condoned polytheism. She drove out the old
gods from their temples made with hands, but did not ensure the
obliteration of them from men’s hearts. The saints whom she
set up in the place of the old deities were certain to acquire
the rank of gods in the estimation of the people and, despite
the niceties of ecclesiastical doctrine, to become in fact objects
of frank and open worship. The adoption of the old places of
worship made it inevitable that the old associations of the pagan
cults should survive and blend themselves with the new ideas,
and that the churches should more often acquire prestige from
their heathen sites than themselves shed a new lustre of sanctity
upon them. In effect, paganism was not uprooted to make room
for the planting of Christianity, but served rather as an old
stock on which a new and vigorous branch, capable indeed
of fairer fruit but owing its very vitality to alien sap, might be
engrafted.</p>

<p>Bitterly and despondently did the early Fathers of the Church,
and above all S. John Chrysostom, complain of the inveteracy of
pagan customs within the pale of the Church, while a kind of
official recognition was given to many superstitions which were
clearly outside that pale, if only by the many forms of exorcism
directed against the evil eye or prescribed for the cure of those
possessed by pagan powers of evil<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. For illustration we need not
fall back upon the past history of the Greek Church; even to-day
she has not succeeded in living down the consequences of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
whilom policy of conciliation. The common-folk indeed profess
and call themselves Christian; their priesthood is a Christian
priesthood; their places of worship are Christian churches; they
make the sign of the cross at every turn; and the names of God
and Christ and the Virgin are their commonest ejaculations. But
with all this external Christianity they are as pagan and as
polytheistic in their hearts as were ever their ancestors. By their
acceptance of Christianity they have increased rather than
diminished their number of gods: in their conception of them
and attitude towards them they have made little advance since
the Homeric Age: and practically all the religious customs most
characteristic of ancient paganism, such as sacrifice, the taking of
auspices, and the consultation of oracles, continue with or without
the sanction of the Church down to the present day.</p>

<p>These are strong statements to make concerning even the
humblest and most ignorant members of the Holy Orthodox
Church: but I shall show, I think, that they do not exceed the
warranty of facts.</p>

<p>First of all then the peasant believes himself to be ever
compassed about by a host of supernatural beings, who have
no relation with his Christian faith, and some of whom he unconsciously
acknowledges, by the very names that he applies to
them, as ‘pagan’ beings and ‘outside’ the Christian fold<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. To all
of these&mdash;and they are a motley crew, gods and demons, fairies
and dragons&mdash;he assigns severally and distinctly their looks, their
dispositions, their habitations, and their works. To some of them
he prays and makes offerings; against others he arms and fortifies
himself in the season of their maleficence; but all of them,
whether for good or ill, are to him real existent beings; no
phantoms conjured up by trepidation of mind, but persons whose
substance is proved by sight and hearing and touch.</p>

<p>Nothing is more amazing in the peasantry of modern Greece
than their familiarity with these various beings. More than once
I have overheard two peasants comparing notes on the ghostly
fauna of their respective districts; and the intimate and detailed
character of their knowledge was a revelation in regard to their
powers of visualisation. It is the mountaineers and the mariners
who excel in this; but even the duller folk of the lowlands see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
much that is hidden from foreign eyes. Once however I did
see a nymph&mdash;or what my guide took for one&mdash;moving about in
an olive-grove near Sparta; and I must confess that had I possessed
an initial faith in the existence of nymphs and in the
danger of looking upon them, so lifelike was the apparition that
I might have sworn as firmly as did my guide that it was
a nymph that we had seen, and might have required as strong
a dose as he at the next inn to restore my nerves. The initial
faith in such things, which the child acquires from its mother,
is no doubt an important factor in the visualisation; but it is
certainly strange that often in Greece not one man only but
several together will see an apparition at the same moment, and
even agree afterwards as to what they saw.</p>

<p>These beings then are not the mere fanciful figures of old wives’
fables, but have a real hold upon the peasant’s belief and a firm
place in his religion. To the objects of Christian worship or
veneration&mdash;God and Christ and the Virgin together with the
archangels and all the host of saints&mdash;have been accorded the
highest places and chiefest honours: but beside them, or rather
below them, yet feared and honoured too, stand many of the divine
personalities of the old faith, recognised and distinguished still.
Artemis, Demeter, and Charon, as well as Nymphs and Gorgons,
Lamiae and Centaurs, have to be reckoned with in the conduct of
life; while in folk-stories the memory at least of other deities still
survives. To these remnants of ancient mythology the next
chapter will be devoted; the purely pagan element in the modern
polytheism may be sufficiently illustrated here by a few curious
cases of the use even of the word ‘god’ (<span class="greek">θεός</span>) in reference to
other than the God of Christendom.</p>

<p>In Athens, down to recent times, there was a fine old formula
of blessing in vogue&mdash;and who shall say but that among the
simpler people it may still be heard?&mdash;which combined impartially
the one God and the many:&mdash;<span class="greek">νὰ ς’ ἀξιῶσῃ ὁ Θεὸς νὰ
εὐχαριστήσῃς θεοὺς καὶ ἀνθρώπους</span><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, ‘God fit thee to find favour
with gods and men!’ In the island of Syra, according to Bent<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>,
it was ‘a common belief amongst the peasants that the ghosts of
the ancient Greeks come once a year from all parts of Greece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
to worship at Delos, ... and even to-day they will reverently speak
of the “god in Delos.”’ Another writer mentions a similar expression
as used in several parts of the mainland, though only
it would seem as an ejaculation, <span class="greek">θεὲ τῆς Κρήτης</span> or <span class="greek">γιὰ τὸ θεὸ τῆς
Κρήτης</span> ‘by the god of Crete<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>!’ In the island of Santorini (the
ancient Thera) I personally encountered a still more striking case
of out-spoken polytheism. I chanced one day upon a very old
woman squatting on the extreme edge of the cliff above the great
flooded crater which, though too deep for anchorage, serves
the main town of the island as harbour&mdash;a place more fascinating
in its hideousness than any I have seen. Wondering at
her dangerous position, I asked her what she was doing; and she
replied simply enough that she was making rain. It was two
years since any had fallen, and as she had the reputation of
being a witch of unusual powers and had procured rain in
previous droughts, she had been approached by several of the
islanders who were anxious for their vineyards. Moreover she had
been prepaid for her work&mdash;a fact which spoke most eloquently
for the general belief in her; for the Greek is slow enough (as
doubtless she knew) to pay for what he has got, and never prepays
what he is not sure of getting. True, her profession had its risks,
she said; for on one occasion, the only time that her spells had
failed, some of her disappointed clients whose money she had not
returned tried to burn her house over her one night while she
slept. But business was business. Did I want some rain too?
To ensure her good will and further conversation, I invested
a trifle, and tried to catch the mumbled incantations which
followed on my behalf. Of these however beyond a frequent
invocation of the Virgin (<span class="greek">Παναγία μου</span>) and a few words about
water and rain I could catch nothing; but I must acknowledge
that her charms were effectual, for before we parted the thunder
was already rolling in the distance, and the rain which I had bought
spoilt largely the rest of my stay in the island. The incantations
being finished, she became more confidential. She would not of
course let a stranger know the exact formula which she employed;
that would mar its efficacy: she vouchsafed to me however
with all humility the information that it was not by her own
virtue that she caused the rain, but through knowing ‘the god<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
above and the god below’ (<span class="greek">τὸν ἄνω θεὸ καὶ τὸν κάτω θεό</span>). The
latter indeed had long since given up watering the land; he had
caused shakings of the earth and turned even the sea-water red.
The god above also had once rained ashes when she asked for
water, but generally he gave her rain, sometimes even in summer-time.
One thing she could not make out&mdash;who was the god that
caused the thunder; did I know? I evaded the question, and our
theological discussion went no further, for the god of thunder
was making his voice heard more threateningly, and the old witch
would not stay to make his acquaintance at closer quarters.</p>

<p>The physical interpretation of these references to the god
above and the god below is not difficult. At the present day there
are said to be three springs, and three only, in the whole island;
nor are they of much use to the inhabitants; indeed the only one
which I saw was dry save for a scanty moisture barely sufficient
to keep the rock about it green and mossy: and in fact the
population depends entirely upon rain-water stored up in large
underground cisterns or reservoirs. Clearly the god below no
longer gives water; but that there may have been more spring-water
prior to the great eruptions of 1866 is very probable; for
the people still call certain dry old torrent-beds by which the
island is intersected ‘rivers’ (<span class="greek">ποταμοί</span>), and real rivers with water
in them figure also in several of the local folk-stories. The perversity
of the god above in sending ashes on one occasion instead
of rain may also be understood in reference to the same eruptions,
of which the old woman gave me a vivid description.</p>

<p>But the theology itself is more interesting than its material
basis. This witch&mdash;a good Christian, they told me, but a little
mad, with a madness however of which sane vine-growers were
eager enough to avail themselves&mdash;acknowledged certainly three
gods: the unknown thunder-god was clearly distinct from the
god of the rain who was known to her: and there was also the
god of the waters under the earth, in whose service she had
perhaps followed the calling of a water-finder, and to whom she
ascribed, as did the ancients to Poseidon, the shaking of the earth.</p>

<p>Polytheism then even in its purely pagan form is not yet
extinct in Greece. In the disguise of Christianity, we shall see,
it is everywhere triumphant.</p>

<p>Among the Christian objects of worship&mdash;for I have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
explained that by the common-folk the saints are worshipped as
deities&mdash;the Trinity and the Virgin occupy the highest places,
rivalled perhaps here and there by some local saint of great
repute for miracles, but nowhere surpassed. It is the Virgin
indeed who, in Pashley’s opinion, ‘is throughout Greece the
chief object of the Christian peasant’s worship<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>’; and certainly, I
think, more numerous and more various petitions are addressed
to her than to any person of the Trinity or to any saint. But
the Trinity, or at any rate God (<span class="greek">ὁ Θεός</span>) and Christ (<span class="greek">ὁ Χριστός</span>),
as the peasants say,&mdash;for the Holy Ghost is hardly a personality
to them and is rarely named except in doxologies and formal
invocations&mdash;are of almost equal importance, and are so closely
allied with the Virgin that it is difficult to draw distinctions.</p>

<p>But while the Church has thus secured the first place for her
most venerated figures, the influence of pagan feeling is clearly
seen in the popular conception of this ‘God.’ His position is
just such as that of Zeus in the old <i>régime</i>. He is little more
than the unnamed ruler among many other divinities. His sway
is indeed supreme and he exercises a general control; but his
functions are in a certain sense limited none the less, and his
special province is the weather only. <span class="greek">Ζεὺς ὕει</span>, said the ancients,
and the moderns re-echo their thought in words of the same
import, <span class="greek">βρέχει ὁ Θεός</span>, ‘God is raining,’ or <span class="greek">ὁ Θεὸς ῥίχνει νερό</span>,
‘God is throwing water<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.’ So too the coming and going of the
daylight is described as an act of God; <span class="greek">ἔφεξε</span>, or <span class="greek">ἐβράδει̯ασε,
ὁ Θεός</span>, say the peasants, ‘God has dawned’ or ‘has darkened.’
When it hails, it is God who ‘is plying his sieve,’ <span class="greek">ῥεμμονίζει<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
ὁ Θεός</span>. When it thunders, ‘God is shoeing his horse,’ <span class="greek">καλιγώνει
τ’ ἄλογό του</span>, or, according to another version<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, ‘the hoofs of
God’s horse are ringing,’ <span class="greek">βροντοῦν τὰ πέταλα ἀπὸ τ’ ἄλογο τοῦ
Θεοῦ</span>. Or again the roll of the thunder sometimes suggests quite
another idea; ‘God is rolling his wine-casks,’ <span class="greek">ὁ Θεὸς κυλάει τ’ ἀσκιά
του</span><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, or <span class="greek">τὰ πιθάρι̯α του</span>. And once again, because a Greek wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
cannot be celebrated without a large expenditure of gunpowder,
the booming of the thunder suggests to some that ‘God is
marrying his son’ or ‘God is marrying his daughters,’ <span class="greek">ὁ Θεὸς
παντρεύει τὸν ὑγιό του</span><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, or <span class="greek">ταὶς θυγατέραις του</span><a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>Such expressions as these<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> are in daily use among the Greek
peasantry: and nothing could reveal more frankly the purely
pagan and anthropomorphic conception of God which everywhere
prevails. The God of Christendom is indistinguishable from the
Zeus of Homer. A line from a Cretan distich, in which God is
described as <span class="greek">ἐκεῖνος ἀποῦ συννεφιᾷ κι’ ἀποβροντᾷ καὶ βρέχει</span><a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>,
‘He that gathereth the clouds and thundereth and raineth,’ exhibits
a popular conception of the chief deity unchanged since
Zeus first received the epithets <span class="greek">νεφεληγερέτης</span> and <span class="greek">ὑψιβρεμέτης</span>,
‘cloud-gatherer,’ ‘thunderer on high.’</p>

<p>But even in the province of the weather God has not undivided
control. The winds are often regarded as persons acting
at their own will; and of the north wind in particular men speak
with respect as Sir Boreas (<span class="greek">ὁ κὺρ Βορε̯άς</span>), for as in Pindar’s time
he is still ‘king of the winds<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.’ So too the whirlwind is the
passing of the Nereids, and the water-spout marks the path of
the Lamia of the sea. Even the thunder is not always the
work of God, but some say that the prophet Elias is ‘driving
his chariot,’ or ‘pursuing the dragon.’ The more striking and
irregular phenomena in short are governed by the caprice of
lesser deities&mdash;Christian saints or pagan powers&mdash;while God
directs the more orderly march of nature.</p>

<p>When however we turn from the external world to the life
of man, we find the functions of the supreme God even more
closely circumscribed or&mdash;to put it in another way&mdash;more generally
delegated to others. The daily course of human life with all
its pursuits and passions is under the joint control of the saints
and some of the old Hellenic deities. Of the latter, as I have
said, another chapter must treat: but it should be remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that the peasant does not draw a hard and fast line of distinction
between the two classes with whom for clearness’ sake I am
bound to deal separately. Thus Charon in many of the folk-songs
which celebrate his doings is made to represent himself as
a messenger of God, charged with the duty of carrying off some
man’s soul and unable to grant a respite<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. He is occasionally
addressed even as Saint Charon<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>; and his name constantly occurs
in the epitaphs of country churchyards. A story too in Bernhard
Schmidt’s collection<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> illustrates well the way in which pagan and
Christian elements are thus <span class="lock">interwoven:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘There was once an old man who had been good his whole life
through. In his old age therefore he had the fortune to see his
good angel (<span class="greek">ὁ καλὸς ἄγγελός του</span>); who said to him&mdash;for he loved
him well&mdash;“I will tell thee how thou mayest be fortunate. In such
and such a hill is a cave; go thou in there and ever onward till
thou comest to a great castle. Knock at the gate, and when it is
opened to thee thou wilt see a tall woman before thee, who will
straightway welcome thee and ask thee of thine age and business
and estate. Answer only that thou art sent by me: then will
she know the rest.” Even so did the old man: and the woman
within the earth gave unto him a tablecloth and bade him but
spread it out and say “In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost,” and lo! everything that he wished would
be found thereon. And thus it came to pass.</p>

<p>‘Now when the old man had oft made use of it, it came into
his heart to bid the king unto his house: who, when he saw the
wonder-working cloth, took it from the old man. But because he
was no virtuous man, the cloth did not its task in his hands;
wherefore he threw it out of the window and straightway it
turned to dust. So the old man went again to the woman in the
hill, and she gave him this time a hen that laid a golden egg
every day. When the king heard thereof, he had the hen too
taken away from the old man. Howbeit in his keeping she laid
not, and so he threw the hen also out of window, and she likewise
turned to dust. So in his anger he bade seize the old man
forthwith and cut off his head.</p>

<p>‘But scarce was this done when there appeared before the king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the Mistress of the Earth and of the Sea&mdash;for she was the woman
in the hill&mdash;and when she had told him in brief words what
awaited him after this life in requital for his wickedness, she
stamped with her foot upon the ground, which swallowed up the
castle with the king and all that was therein. But the old man
that was slain had entered into Paradise.’</p>

<p>In this story the Mistress of the Earth and of the Sea (<span class="greek">ἡ
κυρὰ τσῆ γῆς καὶ τσῆ θαλάσσης</span>) is, as we shall see later<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, none
other than Demeter: but pagan as she is, she works in accord
with the good angel (who is evidently her inferior), and orders
the old man to invoke the Trinity.</p>

<p>Thus the peasant does not conceive of any antagonism between
his pagan and his Christian objects of worship; and both classes
are equally deserving of study by those interested in ancient Greek
religion. For while every minutest trait or detail of the modern
peasant’s conception of those ancient deities, who, though despoiled
of temples and organised worship, still survive, may throw some
new ray of light on the divine personalities and the myths of
old time, yet a more broad and comprehensive view of the outlines
of ancient religion may be obtained by contemplating the
worship of Christian saints who, though deficient often in personal
significance, nevertheless by their possession of dedicated shrines
and of all the apparatus of a formal cult occupy more exactly
the position of the old gods and heroes.</p>

<p>The saints then, as I have remarked above, have a large share
in the control of man’s daily life. The whole religious sense of
the people seems to demand a delegation of the powers of one
supreme God to many lesser deities, who, for the very reason
perhaps that they are lower in the scale of godhead, are more
accessible to man. Under the name of saints lies, hardly concealed,
the notion of gods. In mere nomenclature Christianity has had
its way; but none of the old tendencies of paganism have been
checked. The current of worship has been turned towards many
new personalities; but the essence of that worship is the same.
The Church would have its saints be merely mediators with the
one God; but popular feeling has made of them many gods;
their locality and scope of action are defined in exactly the old
way; vows are made to the patron-saint of such and such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
place; invocations are addressed to him in virtue of a designated
power or function.</p>

<p>Local titles are often derived merely from the town or
district in which the church stands, as Our Lady of Tenos, or
S. Gerasimos of Cephalonia. In other cases they have reference
to the surroundings of the sanctuary. The chapel of the Virgin
in the monastery of Megaspelaeon consists of a large cave at the
foot of some towering cliffs, and the dedication is to our Lady
of the Golden Cave (<span class="greek">Παναγία χρυσοσπηλαιώτισσα</span>). In this case
the word ‘golden’ is an imaginative addition, for the interior is
peculiarly dark: but the dedication has been borrowed, owing to
the repute of the original shrine, by churches which have not
even a cave to show. In Amorgos S. George has the title of
Balsamites, derived from the balsam which covers the hill-side on
which stands his church. In Paros several curious dedications are
mentioned by Bent, which he renders as Our Lady of the Lake, Our
Lady of the Unwholesome Place, and S. George of the Gooseberry<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.
In Athens there is a church of which the present dedication is
said to be due to a fire which blackened the <i>icon</i> of the Virgin,
who is known on this account as Our smoke-blackened Lady
(<span class="greek">Παναγία καπνικαρέα</span>), or, it may be, Our Lady of the smoky head,
according as the second half of the compound is connected with
the Turkish word for ‘black’ or the now obsolete Greek word
<span class="greek">κάρα</span>, ‘head<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.’</p>

<p>Titles denoting functions are equally numerous and quaint.
In Rhodes the Archangel Michael is invoked as <span class="greek">πατητηριώτης</span>,
patron of the wine-press<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. S. Nicolas, who has supplanted
Poseidon, often assumes the simple title of ‘sailor’ (<span class="greek">ναύτης</span>).
S. John the Hunter (<span class="greek">κυνηγός</span>) owns a monastery on Mt Hymettus.
In Cimolus there is a church of Our Guiding Lady (<span class="greek">Παναγία
ὁδηγήτρια</span>)<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. SS. Costas and Damien, the physicians, are known
as the Moneyless (<span class="greek">ἀνάργυροι</span>), because their services are given
gratis. S. George at Argostóli has been dubbed the Drunkard
(<span class="greek">μεθυστής</span>)<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>&mdash;thus furnishing a notable parallel to the hero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
celebrated in old time at Munychia as <span class="greek">ἀκρατοπότης</span><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>&mdash;because on
his day, Nov. 3rd, the new wine is commonly tapped and there
is much drinking in his honour.</p>

<p>In other cases the actual name of the saint has determined
his powers or character without further epithet. S. Therapon is
invoked for all kinds of healing (<span class="greek">θεραπεύειν</span>): S. Eleutherios (with
an echo possibly of Eilythuia) to give deliverance (<span class="greek">ἐλευθερία</span>) to
women in childbirth: S. James, in Melos, owing to a phonetic
corruption of <span class="greek">Ἰάκωβος</span> into <span class="greek">Ἄκουφος</span>, to cure deafness<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. S. Elias,
the successor of the sun-god (<span class="greek">ἥλιος</span>), has power over drought and
rain. S. Andrew (<span class="greek">Ἀνδρέας</span>) is implored to make weakly children
‘strong’ (<span class="greek">ἀνδρειωμένος</span>). S. Maura, in Athens, requires that no
sewing be done on her day under pain of warts (locally known as
<span class="greek">μαύραις</span>), which if incurred can only be cured by an application
of oil from her lamp<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. S. Tryphon resents any twisting (<span class="greek">στρήφω</span>)
of thread, as in spinning, on his day; and on the festival of
S. Symeon expectant mothers must touch no utensil of daily toil,
above all nothing black; for S. Symeon ‘makes marks’ (<span class="greek">ὁ Ἄϊ
Συμεὼν σημειόνει</span>), and a birth-mark would inevitably appear on
the child. If however a woman offend unwittingly, she must lay
her hands at once on that part of the body where the birth-mark
will be least disfiguring to the child.</p>

<p>These are only a small selection of the saints whom the
peasant seeks to propitiate, and it may be noted in passing that
among them there are some characters, as among the ancient
deities, either immoral as S. George the Drunkard, or unamiable
as S. Maura, S. Tryphon, and S. Symeon. But a better idea of the
multitude of the popular deities may perhaps be conveyed by
giving a list of those worshipped in a single island with the
functions there ascribed to them. Here is the catalogue given by
a native of Cythnos<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. The Virgin (<span class="greek">Παναγία</span>) is invoked on any
and every occasion, and the SS. Anargyri (Costas and Damien)
in all cases of illness. S. Panteleëmon is a specialist in eye-diseases,
S. Eleutherios in obstetrics, S. Modestes in veterinary
work, S. Vlasios in ulcers etc. S. Charalampes and S. Varvara
(<span class="greek">Βαρβάρα</span>) deliver from pestilences, and S. Elias from drought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
The power of protecting children from ailments is ascribed to
S. Stylianos, and that of saving sailors from the perils of the sea
to S. Nicolas, S. Sostes, and the SS. Akindyni (<span class="greek">ἀκίνδυνοι</span>).
S. Tryphon deals with noxious insects, S. John the Baptist with
ague, S. Menas with loss of goods, S. Paraskeve (Friday) with
headache: while S. Aekaterine (Catherine) and S. Athanasios
assist anxious mothers to marry off their daughters.</p>

<p>As in the multiplicity of the objects of worship, so too in the
mental attitude of the worshipper, there is little change since first
were written the words <span class="greek">δῶρα θεοὺς πείθει</span>, ‘Gifts win the gods.’
There are certain great occasions, it is true, now as in old days, on
which religious feeling attains a higher level, and the mercenary
expectation of blessings is forgotten in whole-hearted adoration
of the blesser. But in general a spirit of bargaining tempers the
peasant’s prayer, and a return is required for services rendered.
A sketch of the religious sentiments of the Sphakiotes given
by the head of a Cretan monastery is worth reproducing, for
it is typical of the whole Greek folk. ‘The faith,’ he writes, ‘of
these highlanders in Jesus Christ is sincere in every way, reverent,
deep-seated, and unshaken, but unfortunately it is not free from
superstitious fancies which mar this otherwise great merit. Many
of them are fully persuaded that God, Our Lady, and the Saints
go to and fro unseen above their heads, watch each man’s actions,
and take part in his quarrels, like the gods of Homer. They
are under an obligation to work constant miracles, to vindicate
and avenge, to listen readily to each man’s requests and petitions,
whether they be just or no. Many of the people go off cattle-lifting
or on other wrongful enterprises, and at the same time call
upon Our Lady, or any other saints of repute as wonder-workers,
to assist them, and as payment for success promise them gifts!
To some of the Saints they attribute greater power and grace
than to the God who glorified them. In the same way they show
greater reverence for this or that church or <i>icon</i>, and bring
presents from great distances, in the belief that it has miraculous
powers, without understanding that Faith works miracles equally
in all places<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.’</p>

<p>Such is the verdict of an educated priest of the Greek
Church who deplores the polytheism and idolatry of the common-folk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
among whom he lives, and who in so doing speaks with
the authority of intimate knowledge. Nor can the justice of
the verdict be questioned by any one who has entered one of
the more highly reputed churches of Greece and observed the
votive offerings which adorn or disfigure it. For these offerings
are of two qualities just as the motives which inspire them
are twofold. There are the genuine thank-offerings, selected for
their beauty or worth, which commemorate gratefully some
blessing received; of such the treasury of the Church of the
Annunciation in Tenos is full&mdash;gold and silver plate, bibles and
service-books in rich bindings studded with jewels, embroideries
of Oriental silk unmatched in skill and splendour. But there
is another class, the propitiatory offerings designed to place the
offerer in a special way under the protection of the saint. Most
characteristic among these are the shreds of infected clothing sent
by some sick person to the church of the particular saint whose
healing power he invokes. Just as in the province of magic the
possession of a strip of a man’s clothing gives to the witch a
control over his whole person, so in the religious sphere the
dedication of some disease-laden rag from the body of the
sufferer places him under the special care of the saint. In the
church of ‘S. John of the Column’ at Athens the ancient pillar
round which the edifice has been built is always garnished with
dirty rags affixed by a daub of candle-grease; and if the saint
cures those who send these samples of their fevers, he must
certainly kill some of those who visit his sanctuary in person.
To this class of offerings belong also the bulk of the silver-foil
trinkets which are so cheap that the poorest peasant can afford
one for his tribute, and so abundant that at Tenos out of this
supply of metal alone have been fashioned the massive silver
candelabra which light the whole church. These trinkets are
models of any object which the worshipper wishes to commend
to the special attention of the saint. At Tenos they most frequently
represent parts of the human body, for there the Virgin
is above all a goddess of healing; but a vast assortment of models
of other objects committed to her care may also be seen&mdash;horses
and mules, agricultural implements, boats, sheaves of corn to
represent the harvest, bunches of grapes in emblem of the vintage;
there is no limit to the variety; anything for which a man craves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the saint’s blessing is thus symbolically confided to her keeping.
Doubtless among them there are a number of thank-offerings for
mercies already received; I remember in particular a realistic
model of a Greek coasting steamer with a list attached giving the
names of the captain and crew who dedicated it in gratitude for
deliverance from shipwreck. It may even be that some few of the
models of eyes and limbs are thank-offerings for cures effected, and
in beauty or worth are all that the peasant’s artistic sense desires
or his purse affords. But the majority of them, as I have said,
are the gifts of those whose prayers are not yet answered and who
thus keep before the eyes of the saint the maladies which crave
her healing care.</p>

<p>Other offerings again may be dedicated with either motive.
Candles and incense are equally suited to win a favour or to repay
one. But whether the motive be propitiation or gratitude, the
whole system is a legacy of the pagan world and permeated with
the spirit of paganism. Everywhere the Christian disguise of the
old religion is easily penetrable; the Church for instance has
forbidden the use of graven images, and only in one or two places
do statues or even reliefs survive: but the painted <i>icons</i> which are
provided in their stead satisfy equally well the common-folk’s
instinct for idolatry.</p>

<p>Vows conditional upon the answering of some prayer usually
conform outwardly at least to Christian requirements. Scores of
the small chapels with which the whole country is dotted have
been built in payment of such a vow; and often a boy may be
seen dressed in a miniature priest’s costume, because in some
illness his mother devoted him to the service of God or of some
saint for a number of years if only he should recover. But the
idea of bargaining by vows is more pagan than Christian, and
sometimes indeed an even clearer echo of ancient thought is
heard, as when a girl vows to the Virgin a silver girdle if she
will lay her in her lover’s arms<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<p>Miracles again are expected of the higher powers in return for
man’s services to them; for as the proverb runs, <span class="greek">ἅγιος ποῦ δὲν
θαυματουργεῖ, δὲν δοξάζεται</span>, ‘it is a sorry saint who works no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
wonders.’ And wonders are worked as the people expect&mdash;some
in appearance, some in fact.</p>

<p>A sham miracle is annually worked by the priests of a church
near Volo in Thessaly. Within the walls, still easily traced, of the
old town of Demetrias on a spur of Mount Pelion stands an
unfinished church dedicated to the Virgin. Here on the Friday
after Easter there is a concourse from all Thessaly to see the
miracle. At the east end of the church, on the outside, a square
tank has been sunk ten or twelve feet below the level of the
church floor, exposing, on the side formed by the church wall,
ancient foundations&mdash;perhaps of some temple where the same
miracle was worked two thousand years ago. The miracle consists
in the filling of this tank with water; but seeing that under the
floor of the church itself there are cisterns to which a shaft
in each aisle descends, and that the tank outside, sunk, as has
been said, to a lower level, undisguisedly derives its water from
a hole in the foundations of the church, there is less of the
marvellous in the fact that the priests by opening some sluice
fill the tank than in the simple faith with which the throng from
all parts presses to obtain a cupful of the miraculously fertilizing
but withal muddy liquid. The women drink it, the men carry it
home to sprinkle a few drops on cornfield or vineyard.</p>

<p>Genuine miracles, at any rate of healing, seem to be well
established. After personal investigation and enquiry at the
great festival of Tenos I concluded that some faith-cures had
actually occurred. Some travellers<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> indeed have been inclined to
scoff at these miracles and to write them down mere fabrications
of interested priests. But in an official ‘Description of some of
the miracles of the wonder-working <i>icon</i> of the Annunciation in
Tenos’ the total number claimed down to the year 1898 is only
forty-four, that is to say not an average even of one a year; and
a large majority of the cases detailed&mdash;including twelve cases of
mental derangement, eleven of blindness, and ten of paralysis,
none of them congenital,&mdash;might I suppose come under the category
of nervous diseases for which a faith-cure is possible; while
several of the remainder, such as the case of a man who at first
sight of the <i>icon</i> coughed up a fish bone which had stuck in
his throat for two years, do not pass the bounds of belief; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
even if the priests do sometimes set false or exaggerated rumours
afloat, it must be conceded that the peasant, who has faith enough
to believe their stories, has also faith enough, if faith-cures ever
occur, to render such a cure possible in his case. Indeed no one
who has been to the great centres of miraculous healing can fail
to be impressed by the unquailing faith of the pilgrims. Year by
year they come in their thousands, bringing the maimed and the
halt and the blind, and, more pitiful still, the hopelessly deformed,
for whose healing a miracle indeed were needed. Year by year
these are laid to sleep in the church or in its precincts on the
eve of the festival. Year by year they are carried where the
shadow of the <i>icon</i> as it passes in procession may perchance fall
on them. Year by year they are sprinkled with water from the
holy spring. And year by year most of them depart as they came,
maimed and halt and blind and horribly misshapen. Yet faith
abides undimmed; hope still blossoms; and they go again and
again until they earn another release than that which they crave.
The very dead, it is said, have ere now been brought from neighbouring
islands, but the <i>icon</i> has not raised them up. There are
but few indeed whose faith has made them whole; but for my
part I do not doubt that a boy’s sight was restored at Tenos in
the year that I was there (1899), or that similar occurrences are
well established at such shrines as that of the Virgin at Megaspelaeon,
of S. George in Scyros, or of S. Gerasimos in Cephalonia.</p>

<p>Closely bound up with these miraculous cures is the old pagan
practice of <span class="greek">ἐγκοίμησις</span>, sleeping in the sanctuary of the god whose
healing touch is sought. At Tenos the majority of the pilgrims
who come for the festival of Lady-day can only afford to stop
for the one night which precedes it. The sight then is strange
indeed. The whole floor of the church and a great part of the
courtyard outside is covered with recumbent worshippers. With
them they have brought mattresses and blankets for those of
the sick for whom a stone floor is too hard; by their side
is piled baggage of all descriptions, cooking utensils, loaves of
bread, jars of wine or water, everything in fact necessary for a
long night’s watch or slumber. And on this mass of close-packed
suffering worshippers the doors of the church are locked from nine
in the evening till early next morning. Shortly before the closing-hour
I picked my way with difficulty in the dim light over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
prostrate forms from the south to the north door. The atmosphere
was suffocating and reeked with the smoke of wax tapers
which all day long the pilgrims had been burning before the
<i>icon</i>. Every malady and affliction seemed to be represented; the
moaning and coughing never stopped: and I wondered, not whether
there would be any miraculous cures, but how many deaths there
would be in the six or seven hours of confinement before even the
doors were again opened.</p>

<p>But this is the practice at its worst. Where there is more time
available, there is nothing insanitary in it. In the list of cures
at Tenos, to which I have alluded, there are many cases in which
the patient spent not one night only but several months in the
church. As a typical case I may take that of a sailor who while
keeping look-out on a steamer in the harbour of Patras had some
kind of paralytic seizure. He was taken to Tenos and for four
months suffered terribly. Then about midday at Easter he had
fallen asleep and heard a voice bidding him rise. He woke up and
asked those about him who had called him; they said no one;
so he slept again. This happened twice. The third time on
hearing the voice he opened his eyes and saw entering the church
a woman of unspeakable beauty and brilliance, and at the shock
he rose to his feet and began to walk; and the same day accompanied
the festival procession round the town to the astonishment
of all the people.</p>

<p>When I was in Scyros I heard of an equally curious case of
a long-deferred cure which had recently taken place and was
the talk of the town. For seven consecutive years a man from
Euboea had brought his wife, who was mad, to the church
of S. George to ‘sleep in’ for forty days. Shortly before I
arrived the last of these periods was just drawing to a close, when
one night both the man and his wife saw a vision of S. George
who came and laid his hand on her head; and in the morning she
woke sane. Of her sanity when I saw her&mdash;for they were still in
the island, paying, I think, some vow which the man had made&mdash;I
had no doubt; and the evidence of the people of the place who
for seven years previously had seen her mad seemed irrefragable.</p>

<p>The instances which I have cited are from the records of
churches which have succeeded to the reputation possessed by
Epidaurus in antiquity. These owing to the enthusiasm which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
their fame inspires are probably the scenes of more faith-cures
than humbler and less known sanctuaries. But in every church
throughout the land the observance of the custom may occasionally
be seen; for in the less civilised districts at any rate it is among
the commonest remedies for childish ailments for a mother to pass
the night with her child in the village church.</p>

<p>We shall notice in later chapters the remnants of other pagan
institutions which the Greek Church has harboured&mdash;an oracle
established in a Christian chapel and served by a priest&mdash;a church-festival
at which sacrifice is done and omens are read&mdash;the survival
of ancient ‘mysteries’ in the dramatic celebration of Good Friday
and Easter. For the present enough has been said to show that,
even within the domain of what is nominally Christian worship,
the peasant of to-day in his conception of the higher powers and
in his whole attitude towards them remains a polytheist and a
pagan. And as in this aspect of religion, so in that other which
concerns men’s care for the dead and their conception of the
future life, the persistence of pagan beliefs and customs is constantly
manifest. The ancient funeral usages are undisturbed;
and in the dirges which form part of them the heaven and the
hell of Christianity seem almost unknown: ‘the lower world’ (<span class="greek">ὁ
κάτω κόσμος</span>), over which rules neither God nor the Devil but
Charon, is the land to which all men alike are sped.</p>

<p>But there is no need to dilate upon these matters yet. It
is clear enough already, I hope, that the fact of Greece being
nominally a Christian country should not preclude the hope of
finding there instructive survivals of paganism. The Church
did not oust her predecessor. By a policy of conciliation and
compromise she succeeded indeed in imposing upon Hellenic
religion the name of Christianity and the Christian code of
morality and all the external appanages of Christian worship:
but in the essentials of religion proper she deferred largely to the
traditional sentiments of the race. She utilised the sanctuaries
which other associations had rendered holy; she permitted or
adopted as her own the methods by which men had approached
and entreated other gods than hers; she condoned polytheism by
appropriating the shrines of gods whom men had been wont to
worship to the service of saints whom they inevitably would worship
as gods instead; and even so she failed to suppress altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the ejected deities. The result is that for the peasant Christianity
is only a part of a larger scheme of religion. To the outside
observer it may appear that there are two distinct departments
of popular religion, the one nominally Christian, devoted to the
service of God and the Saints, provided with sanctuaries and all
the apparatus of worship, served by a regular priesthood, limited
by dogma and system; the other concerned with those surviving
deities of pre-Christian Greece to whom we must next turn, free
in respect of its worship alike from the intervention of persons
and the limitations of place, obedient only to a traditional lore
which each may interpret by his own feelings and augment by
his own experience. But the peasant seems hardly sensible of
any such contrast. His Christian and his pagan deities consort
amicably together; prayer and vow and offering are made to
both, now to avert their wrath, now to cajole them into kindness;
the professed prophets of either sort, the priests and the witches,
are endowed with kindred powers; everywhere there is overlapping
and intertwining. And when the very authorities of the
Greek Church have adopted or connived at so much of pagan
belief and custom, how should the common-folk distinguish
any longer the twin elements in their blended faith? Their
Christianity has become homogeneous with their paganism, and
it is the religious spirit inherited from their pagan ancestors
by which both alike are animated.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SURVIVAL OF PAGAN DEITIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<h3 class="nobreak">§ 1. <span class="smcap">The Range of Modern Polytheism.</span></h3>

<p>Thus far we have considered paganism in its bearing and
influence upon modern Greek Christianity. We have seen how
the Church, in endeavouring to widen her influence, countenanced
many practices and conciliated many prejudices of a people whose
temperament needed a multitude of gods and whose piety could
pay homage to them all, a people moreover to whom the criterion
of divinity was neither moral perfection nor omnipotence. From
the ethical standpoint some of the ancient gods were better, some
worse than men: in point of power they were superhuman but
not almighty. Some indeed claimed that there was no difference
in origin between mankind and its deities. ‘One is the race
of men’ sang Pindar ‘with the race of gods; for one is the
mother that gave to both our breath of life: yet sundered are
they by powers wholly diverse, in that mankind is as naught, but
heaven is builded of brass that abideth ever unshaken<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.’ One in
origin, they are diverse in might. The test of godhead is power
sufficing to defy death. Rightly therefore did Homer make
‘deathless’ and ‘everbeing’ his constant epithets for the gods.
Immortality alone is the quality which distinguishes them in
kind and not merely in degree from men, and makes them
worthy of worship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>
<p>A people wedded to such conceptions were naturally ready
enough to install new immortals of whom they had not known
before, but reluctant to depose in their favour those whom they
and their forefathers had known and served. Dangers were to
be apprehended from neglect; blessings were to be secured by
tendance. Greater honour might be paid to one god, less to
another; but from no immortal should service be wholly withheld:
even unconscious oversights should be remedied by offerings
‘to an unknown god.’ Such in its essence was the popular
religion, inconsistent it may be and not deeply intellectual, but
in sympathies very broad&mdash;broad enough to encompass the
worship of all immortals, broad as the earth and the sky and
the sea wherein they dwelt and moved.</p>

<p>So vital and so deep-seated in the hearts of the common-folk
are these religious tendencies, that even at the present day when
the word ‘Christian’ has become a popular synonym for ‘Greek’
in contradistinction not only with ‘Mohammedan,’ but even
sometimes with ‘Western’ or ‘Catholic’ or with ‘Protestant,’ and
when horror would be excited by any imputation of polytheism,
there are yet recognised a large number of superhuman and for
the most part immortal beings, whom the Church has been able
neither to eradicate from the popular mind nor yet to incorporate
under the form of saints or devils in her own theological system.
These beings, whether benignant to man or maleficent, are all
treated as divine. In ancient times the common people had
probably little appreciation of the various grades of divinity;
indeed it was one of the seven sages, we are told, who first
differentiated God and the lesser deities and the heroes<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>; and at
the present day the common-folk are certainly no more subtle of
understanding than they were then. God and the Saints and
these pagan powers are all feared and worshipped in the several
ways traditionally suited to each; but the fact of worship proclaims
them all alike to be gods.</p>

<p>The origin of the non-Christian deities, even if we were
unable to identify any of them with the gods of classical Greece,
would be clearly enough proved by some of the general terms
under which all of them are included. Those who use these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
terms indeed no longer appreciate their significance; for all sense
of antagonism between the pagan and Christian elements in the
popular religion has, as we have seen, long been lost. But the
words themselves are a relic of the early days in which the
combat of Christianity with the heathen world was still stern.
Among the most widespread of these terms is the word <span class="greek">ξωτικά</span><a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
(i.e. <span class="greek">ἐξωτικά</span>), the ‘extraneous’ powers, clearly an invention
of the early Christians. The phrase ‘those that are without’
(<span class="greek">οἱ ἔξω</span> or <span class="greek">οἱ ἔξωθεν</span>) was used by S. Paul first<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and afterwards
generally by the Fathers of the Church to denote men
of all other persuasions. In the fourth century Basil of Caesarea
employed the adjective <span class="greek">ἐξωτικός</span> also in a corresponding sense<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.
This word no doubt became popular, and hence <span class="greek">τὰ ἐξωτικά</span>, ‘the
extraneous ones,’ became a convenient term by which to denote
comprehensively all those old divinities whose worship the Church
disallowed but even among her own adherents could not wholly
suppress. Another comprehensive term equally significant, if not
so commonly used, is <span class="greek">τὰ παγανά</span><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>, ‘the pagan ones.’ This is in
use in the Ionian islands and some parts of the mainland, but I
have not met with it nor found it understood in the Peloponnese
or in the islands of the Aegean Sea<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. In Cephalonia it is chiefly,
though not exclusively, applied to a species of supernatural beings
usually called callicántzari (<span class="greek">καλλικάντζαροι</span>) of whom more anon:
the reason of this restriction may be either the fact that these
monsters&mdash;to judge from the folk-stories of the island&mdash;so far
outnumber there all other kinds of ‘pagan’ beings that this one
species has almost appropriated to itself the generic name, or that
in old time, when the word <span class="greek">παγανά</span>, ‘pagan,’ was still understood
in the sense which we attribute to it, these monsters were deemed
specially ‘pagan’ because, as we shall see later, they delight in
disturbing a season of Christian gladness. But elsewhere the
term, still employed in what must have been its original meaning,
comprises all kinds of non-Christian deities; and in earlier times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
‘the pagan ones’ was probably as frequent an expression as its
synonym ‘the extraneous ones.’ To these may perhaps be added
the rare appellation recorded by Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, <span class="greek">τσίνια</span>: for if the
derivation from <span class="greek">τζίνα</span>, ‘fraud,’ ‘deceit,’ be right, it will mean
‘the false gods.’</p>

<p>Besides these three names, which indicate the pre-Christian
origin of these deities, there are several others&mdash;some in universal
usage, others local and dialectic,&mdash;which represent them in various
aspects. As a class of ‘divinities’ they are called <span class="greek">δαιμόνια</span>: as
‘apparitions,’ whose precise nature often cannot be further determined,
<span class="greek">φάσματα</span> or <span class="greek">φαντάσματα</span> and, in Crete, <span class="greek">σφανταχτά</span><a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>: as
swift and ‘sudden’ in their coming and going, <span class="greek">ξαφνικά</span><a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>: as
ghostly and passing like a vision, <span class="greek">εἰδωλικά</span>: as denizens, for the most
part, of the air, <span class="greek">ἀερικά</span>: and from their similarity to angels,
<span class="greek">ἀγγελικά</span>.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that the first and the last of these terms,
<span class="greek">δαιμόνια</span> and <span class="greek">ἀγγελικά</span>, should be practically interchangeable; for
the Church at any rate did her best in early days to make the
former understood in the sense of ‘demons’ or ‘devils’ rather
than ‘deities.’ But the attempted change of meaning seems to
have failed to make much impression on a people who did not
view goodness as an essential of godhead; and in later times the
Church herself, or many of her less educated clergy at any rate,
surrendered to the popular ideas. Father Richard<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>, a Jesuit
resident during the seventeenth century in the island of Santorini,
mentions the case of an old Greek priest who had long made
a speciality of exorcism and was prepared to expel angels and
demons alike from the bodies of those who were afflicted by them.
The priest when questioned by the Jesuit as to what distinction
he drew between demons and angels, replied that the demons
came from hell, while the angels were <span class="greek">ἀερικόν τι</span>, a species
of aërial being; but while he maintained a theoretical difference
between them, his practice betrayed a belief that both were
equally harmful. Exorcism had to be employed in cases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
‘angelic’ as well as of ‘demoniacal’ possession; and Father
Richard details the cruelties and tortures inflicted upon a woman
suspected of the former in order to make the pernicious angelic
spirit within her confess its name. The characters of <span class="greek">δαιμόνια</span>
and <span class="greek">ἀγγελικά</span> are in fact the same, and the subtle theological
distinctions which might be drawn between them are naturally
lost on a people who see them treated even by the priests as
equally baneful.</p>

<p>A few other local or dialectic names remain to be noticed.
Two of them, <span class="greek">στοιχει̯ά</span> and <span class="greek">τελώνια</span>, denote properly two several
species of supernatural beings&mdash;the former being the <i>genii</i> of fixed
places<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, and the latter aërial beings chiefly concerned with the
passage of men from this world to the next<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>&mdash;and are only loosely
and locally employed in a more comprehensive sense. The name
<span class="greek">σμερδάκια</span>, recorded from Philiatrá in Messenia, is apparently a
diminutive form from a root meaning ‘terrible<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.’ A Cretan word
<span class="greek">καντανικά</span> is of less certain etymology, but if, as has been surmised,
it has any relation with the verb <span class="greek">καντανεύω</span>, ‘to go down
to the underworld,’ and hence ‘to fall into a trance,’ (‘entranced’
spirits being thought temporarily to have departed thither,)
it may denote either denizens of the lower world or beings
who frighten men into a senseless and trance-like state<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Next
come the two words <span class="greek">ζούμπιρα</span> and <span class="greek">ζωντόβολα</span>, of which I believe
the interpretation is one and the same. Bernhard Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>,
whose work I have constantly consulted in this and later
chapters, would derive the former from a middle-Greek word
<span class="greek">ζόμβρος</span><a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>, equivalent to the ancient <span class="greek">τραγέλαφος</span>, a fantastic
animal of Aristophanic fame; but it was explained to me in Scyros
to be a jocose euphemism as applied to supernatural beings and
to denote properly parasitic insects. The implied combination of
superstitious awe in avoiding the name of supernatural things
with a certain broad humour in substituting what is, to the
peasant, one of the lesser annoyances of life is certainly characteristic
of the Greek folk; and the accuracy of the explanation given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to me is confirmed by the fact that in the island of Cythnos
the other word, <span class="greek">ζωντόβολα</span>, is recorded to bear also the meaning
of ‘insects<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.’ The joke, if such it be, must date from a long time
back and in its prime must have enjoyed a widespread popularity;
for at Aráchova on the slopes of Parnassus, a place far distant
from Scyros, the word <span class="greek">ζούμπιρα</span> is employed in the sense of
supernatural beings by persons who apparently are quite ignorant
of its original meaning<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. To these difficult terms must be added
a few euphemisms of a simple nature&mdash;<span class="greek">τὰ πίζηλα</span> (i.e. <span class="greek">ἐπίζηλα</span>)
‘the enviable ones’ in one village of Tenos<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, and in many places
such general terms as <span class="greek">οἱ καλοί</span> ‘the noble,’&mdash;<span class="greek">οἱ ἀδερφοί μας</span> ‘our
brothers,’&mdash;<span class="greek">οἱ καλορίζικοι</span> ‘the fortunate ones,’&mdash;<span class="greek">οἱ χαρούμενοι</span>
‘the joyful ones.’ These evasions of a more direct nomenclature
are very frequent, and, since the choice of epithet is
practically at the discretion of the speaker, it would be impossible
to compile a complete list of them.</p>

<p>How far each of these names may be applied in general to all
the classes of pagan gods and demons and monsters whom I am
about to describe is a question which I cannot determine. On
the one hand many of the names, as we have seen, are purely
local, confined to a few villages or districts or islands and
unknown and unintelligible elsewhere: and on the other hand
some of these supernatural beings themselves are equally local,
and my information concerning them has been gathered from
widely separated regions of the Greek world. Hence it follows
that while the several terms which I have explained are comprehensive
in local usage and include all the supernatural beings
locally recognised, it is impossible to say whether the users of
them would think fit to extend them to the deities of other
districts. Probably they would do so; but only for the most
widely current terms, <span class="greek">δαιμόνια</span> and <span class="greek">ἐξωτικά</span>, can I claim with
assurance anything like universal application.</p>

<p>The surviving pagan deities fall naturally into two classes.
There are the solitary and individual figures such as Demeter,
and there is the gregarious and generic class to which belong for
example the Nymphs. An exceptional case may occur in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
some originally single personality has been multiplied into a
whole class. The Lesbian maiden Gello, who, according to a
superstition known to Sappho<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, in revenge for her untimely
death haunted her old abodes preying upon the babes of women
whose motherhood she envied, is no longer one but many; the
place of a maiden, whom death carried off ere she had known the
love of husband and children, has been taken by withered witch-like
beings who none the less bear her name and resemble her in
that they light, like Harpies, upon young children and suck out their
humours<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. But in the main the division holds; there are single
gods and there are groups of gods. Of the former, in several
cases, there is very little to record. Such memory of them as still
lingers among the people is confined perhaps to a single folk-story
out of the many that have been preserved. In such cases I do not
feel entire confidence that the reference is a piece of genuine
tradition; in spite of the popular form in which the stories are
cast, it is always possible that, owing to the spread of education,
some scholastic smatterings of ancient mythology have been introduced
by the story-teller. There are certainly plenty of tales
to be heard about Alexander the Great which are drawn from
literary sources; and it is possible that two stories published
by Schmidt which contain apparent reminiscences of Poseidon
and of Pan are vitiated, from the point of view of folklore, in the
same way. Fortunately the cases in which this reserve must be
felt are few and in the nature of things unimportant: for, though
proof of genuine tradition would be interesting, yet a single
modern allusion is not likely to throw any light on the ancient
conception of a deity or his cult. Where on the other hand
modern folklore is more abundant&mdash;and in the case of the groups
of lesser deities above all there is ample store of information&mdash;it
is possible that study of the popular conceptions of to-day may
illumine our understanding of ancient religion.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 2. <span class="smcap">Zeus.</span></h3>

<div class="center"><span class="greek">Ἐκ Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα.</span></div>

</div>

<p>To Zeus, the ancient father of gods and men, belongs precedence;
but there is in truth little room for him in the modern
scheme of popular religion. His functions have been transferred
to the Christian God, and his personality merged in that of the
Father whom the Church acknowledges. But though he is no
longer a deity, the ancient conception of him has imposed narrow
limitations upon the character of his successor. We have noted
already that the God now recognised exercises the same general
control, as did formerly Zeus, over all the changes and chances of
this mortal life, but has, again resembling Zeus, for his special
province only the regulation of the more monotonous phases of
nature and the weather. The more unusual phenomena, and
among them sometimes even the thunder, to which S. Elias has pretensions,
are delegated to saints or to non-Christian deities; but
for the most part the thunder remains the possession of God, as it
was always that of Zeus; and its more important concomitant,
the lightning, is never, I think, attributed to S. Elias, but is
wielded by God alone.</p>

<p>The very name of this weapon which the Christian God has
inherited is suggestive of the Olympian <i>régime</i>. Much has been
heard lately of the double-headed axe as a religious symbol which
seems to have been constantly associated, especially in Crete, with
the worship of Zeus. The modern Greek word for what we call
the thunderbolt is <span class="greek">ἀστροπελέκι</span> (a syncopated form of <span class="greek">ἀστραποπελέκι</span>
by loss of one of two concurrent syllables beginning with
the same consonant), and means literally a ‘lightning-axe.’ The
weapon therefore which the supreme God wields is conceived as
an axe-shaped missile; and, though in the ancient literature
which has come down to us we may nowhere find the word
<span class="greek">πέλεκυς</span> used of the thunderbolt, there is no reason why the
modern word should not be the expression of a conception inherited
from antiquity and so furnish a clue to what in itself
seems a simple and suitable explanation of the much-canvassed
symbol.</p>

<p>Again the divine associations of the thunderbolt now as in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
reign of Zeus are attested by the awe in which men and cattle,
trees and houses, which have been struck by lightning, are
universally held&mdash;awe of that primitive kind which does not
distinguish between the sacred and the accursed. It is sufficient
that particular persons or objects have come into close contact
with divine power; that contact sets them apart; they must not do
common work or be put to common uses. In old days any place
which had been struck was distinguished by the erection of an altar
and the performance of sacrifice, but at the same time it was left
unoccupied and, save for sacrificial purposes, untrodden<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>; it was
both honoured and avoided. In the case of persons however
the sense of awe verged on esteem. ‘No one,’ says Artemidorus,
‘who has been struck by lightning is excluded from citizenship;
indeed such an one is honoured even as a god<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.’ The same
feeling is still exhibited. The peasant makes the sign of the
cross as he passes any scorched and blackened tree-trunk; but if
a man has the fortune to be struck and not killed, he may indulge
a taste for idleness for the rest of his life&mdash;his neighbours will
support him&mdash;and enjoy at the same time the reputation of being
something more than human.</p>

<p>But in spite of the reverent awe which the victim of the
lightning excites, the thunderbolt is often viewed now, as in old
time, as the instrument of divine vengeance. The people of
Aráchova, when they see a flash, explain the occurrence in the
phrase <span class="greek">κάποιον διάβολον ἔκαψε</span>, ‘He has burnt up some devil,’
and the implied subject of the verb, as in most phrases describing
the weather, is undoubtedly God<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. The same idea, in yet more
frankly pagan garb, is well exhibited in a story from Zacynthos<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>,
which is nothing but the old myth of the war of the Titans
against Zeus with the names of the actors omitted. The gist of
it is as follows.</p>

<p>The giants once rebelled against God. First they climbed
a mountain and hurled rocks at him; but he grasped his thunderbolts
(<span class="greek">τσακώνει τὰ ἀστροπελέκι̯α του</span>) and threw them at the
giants, and they all fell down from the mountain and many were
killed. Then one whose courage was still unshaken tied reeds to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>gether
and tried to reach to heaven with them (for what purpose,
does not appear in the story; but folk-tales are often somewhat
inconsequent, and this vague incident is probably an imperfect
reminiscence of the legend of Prometheus); but the lightning burnt
him to ashes. Then his remaining companions made a last assault,
but the lightning again slew many of them, and the rest were
condemned to live all their life long shut in beneath a mountain.</p>

<p>This story is one of those which in themselves might be
suspected of scholastic origin or influence; but it so happens
that practically the same story has been recorded from Chios
also, with the slight addition that there the leader of the giants’
assault has usurped the name of Samson. Such corroboration
from the other end of the Greek world goes far to establish the
genuine nature of the tradition.</p>

<p>Thus though Zeus has been generally superseded by the
Christian God, his character and mythic attributes have left a
strong and indelible mark upon the religion of to-day. The
present conception of God is practically identical with the ancient
conception of the deity who was indeed one among many gods
and yet in thought and often also in speech the god <i>par excellence</i>.
Christianity has effected little here beyond the suppression of the
personal name Zeus.</p>

<p>All this, no doubt, illustrates the fusion of paganism with
Christianity rather than the independent co-existence of deities
of the separate systems. But there are two small facts in virtue
of which I have given to Zeus a place among the pagan deities
whose distinct personality is not yet wholly sunk in oblivion. The
men of Aráchova, as we have noticed above, still swear by the
‘god of Crete,’ who can be no other than Zeus; and in Crete itself
there was recently, and may still be, in use the invocation <span class="greek">ἠκοῦτε
μου Ζῶνε θεέ</span>, ‘Hearken to me, O god Zeus<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.’ Such expressions,
though their original force is no longer known by those who use
them, are none the less indications that perhaps not many
generations ago Zeus was still locally recognised and reverenced
as a deity distinct from the Christian God, to whom indeed everywhere
he can only gradually have ceded his position and his
attributes.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 3. <span class="smcap">Poseidon.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>For the survival of any god of the sea in the imagination of
the Greek people I cannot personally vouch. Though I have
been among the seafaring population in many parts, I have never
heard mention of other than female deities. That which I here
set down rests entirely on the authority of Bernhard Schmidt.</p>

<p>In his collection of folk-stories there is one from Zacynthos,
entitled ‘Captain Thirteen,’ which runs as follows<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>:&mdash;A king who
was the strongest man of his time made war on a neighbour.
His strength lay in three hairs on his breast. He was on the point
of crushing his foes when his wife was bribed to cut off the hairs,
and he with thirteen companions was taken prisoner. But the
hairs began to grow again, and so his enemies threw him and his
companions into a pit. The others were killed by the fall, but he
being thrown in last, fell upon them and was unhurt. Over the
pit his enemies then raised a mound. He found however in the
pit a dead bird, and having fastened its wings to his hands flew
up and carried away mound and all with him. Then he soared
high in the air until a storm of rain washed away the clay that
held the feathers to his hands, and he fell into the sea. ‘Then
from out the sea came the god thereof (<span class="greek">ὁ δαίμονας τῆς θάλασσας</span>)
and struck him with a three-pronged fork (<span class="greek">μία πειροῦνα μὲ τρία
διχάλια</span>)’ and changed him into a dolphin until such time as he
should find a maiden ready to be his wife. The dolphin after
some time saved a ship-wrecked king and his daughter, and the
princess by way of reward took him for her husband and the spell
was broken.</p>

<p>Other characteristics of this trident-bearing sea-god are,
according to the same authority<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, that he is in form half human
and half fish; that his wealth, consisting of all treasures lost in
the sea, is so great that he sleeps on a couch of gold; and that he
rides upon dolphins. Thus Poseidon, it appears, (or it may be
Nereus,) has survived locally in the remembrance of the Greek
people as a deity unconnected with Christianity. Far more
generally however his functions have been transferred to S. Nicolas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
whose aid is invariably invoked by seamen in time of peril, and
who has acquired the byname of ‘sailor’ (<span class="greek">ναύτης</span>)<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>The allusion to the sea-god and his trident in the story which
I have repeated must, I think, be accepted with some reserve
as being possibly a scholastic interpolation. I cannot find confirmation
of it in any other folk-story, and moreover the latter
part of the tale is familiar to me in another form. The hero
is usually a young prince who goes out to seek adventures in the
world, not a king who has already a wife at home; and his transformation
into a dolphin is effected by some malicious witch into
whose toils he falls. But while for these reasons I do not put the
story forward as certain evidence of the survival of Poseidon
in the popular memory, I have recounted it at some length
because it is an excellent type of current folk-tales, and from
a study of it, if we may now leave Poseidon and make a brief
digression, we may appreciate the relation existing between such
stories and the myths of antiquity.</p>

<p>The king who was the strongest man of his time has a classical
prototype in the Messenian leader Aristomenes. He too was
thrown with his comrades into a pit by his enemies, the Spartans,
and alone escaped death from the fall, being borne up on the
wings of eagles. Again, the idea of a man’s strength residing in
a certain hair or hairs is well known in ancient mythology; and
although it is by no means peculiar to the Greeks, but is common to
many peoples of the world, we may fairly suppose that the modern
Greek has not borrowed it from outside, but has inherited it from
those ancestors among whose myths was the story of Scylla and
Nisus. Lastly, in the incident of the hero fastening wings to his
arms with clay and his subsequent fall into the sea there are all
the essentials of the legend of Icarus.</p>

<p>Here then combined in one modern folk-story we find the
<i>motifs</i> of three separate ancient myths. And from it and others
of like nature&mdash;for in the collection from which I have borrowed
it there are several stories in which such figures as Midas, the
Sphinx, and the Cyclopes are easily recognised&mdash;an inference
may be drawn as to the real relation of ancient mythology
to modern folk-stories. Certain themes must have existed from
time immemorial, and these have been worked up into tales by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
successive generations of <i>raconteurs</i> with ever-varying settings.
Fresh combinations of <i>motifs</i> have been and are still being tried;
fresh embroidery of detail may be added by each artist; only the
theme in its plainest form, the mere groundwork of story, remains
immutable. This at the same time explains the wide variations
of the same myth even among the ancients themselves, and warns
us not to judge of the value of a modern folk-story or folk-song by
the closeness of its resemblance to any ancient myth which may
have been preserved to us in literature. It was naturally the most
finished and artistic presentment of the story which appealed to
the taste of educated men and thus became the orthodox classical
version; but there is every likelihood that before the story reached
the stage of acknowledged perfection much that was primitive
had been suppressed as inartistic, and much that was not traditional
had been added by the poet’s imagination. The unlettered
story-teller, endowed with less fancy and ignorant of the
conventions of art, is a far trustier vehicle of pure tradition; for
though he feels himself at liberty to compose variations of the
original theme, he certainly has less power and generally less
inclination to do so; for it is on exactness of memory and
even verbal fidelity to the traditional form of the story that the
modern story-teller chiefly prides himself. Hence the modern
folk-story, straight from the peasant’s lips in a form almost verbally
identical with that in which successive generations of peasants
before him narrated it, may contain more genuinely primitive
material than a literary version of it which dates from perhaps
two thousand years or more ago.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 4. <span class="smcap">Pan.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>A story, again from the same collection<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, runs in brief as
follows:&mdash;Once upon a time a priest had a good son who tended
goats. One day ‘Panos’ gave him a kid with a skin of gold.
He at once offered it as a burnt-offering to God, and in answer
an angel promised him whatsoever he should ask. He chose a
magic pipe which should make all hearers dance. So no enemy
could come near to touch him. The king however sent for him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and the goatherd, after making the envoys dance more than once,
voluntarily let himself be taken. The king then threw him into
prison, but he had his flute still with him, and when he played
even houses and rocks danced, and fell and crushed all save him
and his. ‘The whole business,’ concludes the story, ‘was arranged
by Panos to cleanse the world somewhat of evil men.’</p>

<p>Here the pastoral scene and the gift of the magic pipe (not by
Panos himself, it is true, but indirectly thanks to him) suggest
a genuine remembrance of Pan. It was from him that ‘bonus
Daphnis’ learnt the art of music. The form which the name has
assumed is the chief difficulty. The modern nominative, if
formed in the same way as in other words of the same declension,
would naturally be Panas (<span class="greek">Πάνας</span>), and the unusual termination
arouses some suspicion that the narrator of the story had heard
of Pan from some literary source and, as often happens in such
cases, had got the name a little wrong. But if the tale be a
piece of genuine tradition, the conclusion of it is remarkable.
The moral purpose ascribed to the deity seems to indicate a
loftier conception of him than that which is commonly found in
ancient art and literature. But the popular tradition embodied
in the legend is not therefore necessarily at fault; indeed it may
be more true to the conception of Pan which prevailed among the
common-folk in old days than were the portraits drawn and handed
down by the more educated of their contemporaries. The patron-god
of Arcadian shepherd-life would naturally have seemed a rude
being to the cultured Athenians of the fifth century, who but
for his miraculous intervention in the battle of Marathon would
never have honoured him with a temple. But among his original
worshippers it may well be that, besides presiding over the
increase of their flocks, as did Demeter over the increase of their
fields, he was deemed to resemble her also in the possession
of more exalted attributes, so that there was cause indeed for
lamentation over that strange message ‘Great Pan is dead<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.’</p>

<p>But perchance Pan is not dead yet, or if dead not forgotten.
And as this solitary modern story, if it be genuine, testifies to
a longlived remembrance of his better qualities, so in the demonology
of the middle ages a sterner aspect of his ancient character
still secured to him men’s awe. Theocritus<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> gave voice to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
well-known superstition when he made the goat-herd say: ‘Nay,
shepherd, it may not be; in the noontide we may not pipe;
’tis Pan that we fear’; for in his rage if roused from his midday
slumber he was believed to strike the intruder with ‘panic’
terror: and it was this superstition which influenced the translators
of the Septuagint when they rendered the phrase, which
in our Bible version of the Psalms<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> appears as ‘the destruction
that wasteth at noonday,’ by the words <span class="greek">σύμπτωμα καὶ δαιμόνιον
μεσημβρινόν</span>. By the latter half of this phrase the memory of
Pan was undoubtedly perpetuated; for in certain forms of prayer
quoted by Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> in the seventeenth century, among the
perils from which divine deliverance is sought is mentioned more
than once this ‘midday demon’; and a corresponding ‘daemon
meridianus<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>’ found a place of equal dignity among the ghostly
enemies of Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Perhaps even yet in the pastoral uplands of Greece some
traveller will hear news of Pan.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 5. <span class="smcap">Demeter and Persephone.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Of few ancient deities has popular memory been more
tenacious than of Demeter; but in different districts the reminiscences
take very different forms. There are many traces of her
name and cult, and of the legends concerning both her and her
daughter; but in one place they have been Christianised, in
another they have remained pagan.</p>

<p>In so far as she has affected the traditions of the Church,
a male deity, S. Demetrius, has in general superseded her.
Under the title of <span class="greek">στερεανός</span>, ‘belonging to the dry land,’ he
has in most districts taken over the patronage of agriculture;
while his inherited interest in marriage receives testimony from
the number of weddings celebrated, especially in the agricultural
districts, on his day. But at Eleusis, the old home of Demeter’s
most sacred rites, the people, it seems, would not brook the
substitution of a male saint for their goddess, and yielded to
ecclesiastical influence only so far as to create for themselves a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
saint Demetra (<span class="greek">ἡ ἁγία Δήμητρα</span>) entirely unknown elsewhere
and never canonised. Further, in open defiance of an iconoclastic
Church, they retained an old statue of Demeter, and merely
prefixing the title ‘saint’ to the name of their cherished goddess,
continued to worship her as before. The statue was regularly
crowned with garlands of flowers in the avowed hope of obtaining
good harvests, and without doubt prayer was made before it as
now before the pictures of canonical saints. This state of things
continued down to the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Then, in 1801, two Englishmen, named Clarke and Cripps, armed
by the Turkish authorities with a license to plunder, perpetrated
an act unenviably like that of Verres at Enna, and in spite of a
riot among the peasants of Eleusis removed by force the venerable
marble; and that which was the visible form of the great goddess
on whose presence and goodwill had depended from immemorial
ages the fertility of the Thriasian plain is now a little-regarded
object catalogued as ‘No. <span class="allsmcap">XIV</span>, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge,
(much mutilated)<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.’</p>

<p>Saint Demetra however, though lost to sight, was yet dear to
the memory of the village-folk; and in spite of the devastation of
old beliefs and legends which the much-vaunted progress and
education of Greece have committed in the more civilised districts
without conferring any sensible compensation, the antiquarian
Lenormant found in 1860 an old Albanian<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> priest who when
once reassured that no ridicule was intended, recited to him the
following remarkable legend<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>: ‘S. Demetra was an old woman
of Athens, kind and good, who devoted all her little means to
feeding the poor. She had a daughter who was beautiful past
all imagining; since “lady Aphrodite” (<span class="greek">κυρὰ ’φροδίτη</span>) none had
been seen so lovely. A Turkish lord of the neighbourhood of Souli,
who was a wicked man and versed in magic, saw her one day
combing her hair, which was of golden hue and reached to the very
ground, and became passionately enamoured of her. He bided his
time, and having found his chance of speaking with her tried to
seduce her. But she being as prudent as she was beautiful,
repulsed all the miscreant’s advances. Thereupon he resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to carry her off and put her in his harem. One Christmas night,
while Demetra was at church, the Turk (<span class="greek">ὁ ἀγᾶς</span>) forced the door
of her house, seized the girl who was at home alone, carried her off
in spite of her cries of distress, and holding her in his arms leapt
upon his horse. The horse was a wonderful one; it was black in
colour; from its nostrils it breathed out flames, and in one bound
could pass from the East unto the West. In an instant it had
carried ravisher and victim right to the mountains of Epirus.</p>

<p>When the aged Demetra came back from church, she found
her house broken into and her daughter gone; great was her
despair. She asked her neighbours if they knew what had become
of her daughter; but they dared not tell her aught, for they
feared the Turks and their vengeance. She turned her enquiries
to the tree that grew before her house; but the tree could tell her
nothing. She asked the sun, but the sun could give her no help;
she asked the moon and the stars, but from them too she learnt
nothing. Finally the stork that nested on the house-top said to
her: “Long time now we have lived side by side; thou art as old
as I. Listen; thou hast always been good to me, thou hast never
disturbed my nest, and once thou didst help me to drive away the
bird of prey that would have carried off my nestlings. In recompense
I will tell thee what I know of the fate of thy daughter;
she was carried off by a Turk mounted on a black horse, who took
her towards the West. Come, I will set out with thee and we will
search for her together.”</p>

<p>Accompanied by the stork, Demetra started; the time was
winter; it was cold, and snow covered the mountains. The poor
old woman was frozen and could hardly walk; she kept asking of
all those whom she met, whether they had seen her daughter, but
they laughed at her or did not answer; doors were shut in her face
and entrance denied her, for men love not misery; and she went
weeping and lamenting. In this manner however she dragged
her limbs as far as Lepsína (the modern form of the name Eleusis);
but, arriving there, she succumbed to cold and weariness and threw
herself down by the roadside. There she would have died, but
that by good luck there passed by the wife of the <i>khodja-bachi</i>
(or head man of the village), who had been to look after her flocks
and was returning. Marigo&mdash;such was her name&mdash;took pity on
the old woman, helped her to rise and brought her to her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
who was named Nicolas<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. The <i>khodja-bachi</i> was as kind as his
wife; both welcomed as best they could the poor sorrow-stricken
woman, tended her and sought to console her. To reward them
S. Demetra blessed their fields and gave them fertility.</p>

<p>Nicolas, the <i>khodja-bachi</i>, had a son handsome, strong, brave,
and practised, in a word the finest <i>pallikar</i> of all the country side.
Seeing that Demetra was in no condition to continue her journey,
he offered to set to work to recover her daughter, asking only her
hand in recompense. The offer was accepted, and he set out
accompanied by the faithful stork who would not abandon the
undertaking.</p>

<p>The young man walked for many days without finding anything.
At last one night, when he was in a forest right among
the mountains, he caught sight of a great bright light at some
distance. Towards this he hastily bent his steps, but the point
from which the light came was much further off than he had
at first imagined; the darkness had deceived him. Eventually
however he arrived there, and to his great astonishment found
forty dragons lying on the ground and watching an enormous
cauldron that was boiling on the fire. Undismayed by the sight,
he lifted the cauldron with one hand, lit a torch, and replaced the
vessel on the fire. Astounded by such a display of strength, the
dragons crowded round him and said to him, “You who can lift
with one hand a cauldron which we by our united efforts can
scarcely carry, you alone are capable of carrying off a maiden
whom we have long been trying to lay our hands on, and whom
we cannot seize because of the height of the tower wherein a
magician keeps her shut up.” The son of the <i>khodja-bachi</i> of
Lepsína perceived the impossibility of escape from these monsters.
Accompanied by the forty dragons, he approached the tower, and
after having examined it, he asked for some large nails, which he
took and drove into the wall, so as to form a kind of ladder, and
which he kept pulling out again as he ascended to prevent the
dragons from following him. Having arrived at the top and with
some difficulty entered at a small window there, he invited the
dragons to ascend as he had done, one by one, which they did,
thus giving him time to kill each as it arrived while the next was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
climbing up, and to throw it over the other side of the tower,
where there were a large court, a splendid garden, and a fine
castle. Thus rid of his dangerous guardians, he went down
into the interior of the tower and found there S. Demetra’s
daughter, whose beauty at once inspired him with the most
ardent love.</p>

<p>He was kneeling at her feet when suddenly the magician
appeared, and in a fury of anger threw himself upon the young man,
who met him bravely. The former was of superhuman strength,
but Nicolas’ son was not inferior to him. The magician had the
power to transform himself into any thing he might choose; he
changed successively into a lion, into a serpent, into a bird of
prey, into fire&mdash;hoping under some one of these forms to wear
his adversary out; but nothing could shake the courage of the
young man. For three days the combat continued. The first
day the magician seemed beaten, but the next he regained
his advantage; at the end of the day’s struggle he killed his
young opponent, and cut his body into four quarters, which he
hung on the four sides of the tower. Then elated by his victory,
he did violence to Demetra’s daughter, whose chastity he had
hitherto respected. But in the night the stork flew away to a great
distance to fetch a magic herb which it knew, brought it back
in its beak, and rubbed with it the young man’s lips. At once
the pieces of his body came together again and he revived. Great
was his despair when he learnt what had taken place after his
defeat; but he only threw himself upon the magician with the
greater fury the third day, to punish him for his crime.</p>

<p>Once again the young man, it seemed, was on the point of
being vanquished, when suddenly he conceived the happy idea
of invoking the Panagia, vowing that if victorious he would
become a monk at the monastery of Phaneroméne<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. The divine
protection which he had invoked gave him strength and he
succeeded in throwing his adversary: the stork, who had aided
him so much, at once attacked the fallen magician and picked out
his eyes; then with its beak pulled out a white hair noticeable
among the black curls that covered his head. On this hair
depended the life of the Turkish magician, who immediately
expired.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>
<p>His conqueror, taking with him the girl, brought her back to
Lepsína, just at the season when spring was coming and the
flowers were beginning to appear in the fields. Then he went, as
he had vowed, and shut himself up in the monastery. S. Demetra,
having received back her daughter, went away with her. What
became of them afterwards, no one knows; but since that time the
fields of Lepsína, thanks to the blessing of the Saint, have not
ceased to be fertile.’</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to point out the numerous details
of this legend which accord explicitly with the account of the
rape of Persephone in the Homeric hymn. The interspersion of
Christian ideas and reminiscences of Turkish domination and
stories of fabulous monsters may strike oddly on the ear unacquainted
with the vagaries of Greek folk-stories. Yet the
most sceptical could not doubt that the tradition which forms
the groundwork of the legend is none other than the old myth,
or that the four chief actors in the drama are none other than
Demeter and Core, Pluto and Triptolemus. Pluto, masked as
a Turkish <i>agha</i>, is perhaps the least readily recognisable; yet
in one way as a relic of ancient tradition the part he plays is the
most remarkable in the whole legend. It is to Souli in Epirus
that he carries off the maiden. Now this is the district of the
ancient Cocytus and Acheron; here was one of the descents to
the lower world; here Aidoneus held sway; and here, in one
version of the myth<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, was laid the scene of the rape of Persephone
by that god. Hence the claims of two separate localities to the
same mythological distinction seem by some means to have become
incorporated in the single modern legend.</p>

<p>In the same part of Epirus, according to Lenormant, a similar
story to that which he heard at Eleusis concerning S. Demetra’s
daughter, is told, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of S. Demetrius: but since
either a sense of propriety or a want of knowledge prevented him
from publishing the details of it, the mere statement that it
existed is of no great value. But the legend which he narrates
in full may I think be accepted as genuine without corroboration
on the grounds of its own structure. Lenormant has indeed been
accused of <i>mala fides</i> in his own department of archaeology and
of tampering with some of the inscriptions which he published;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
but even if this charge could be substantiated, I should doubt
whether he had either the inclination to invent a legend which
he only mentions in a cumbrous foot-note, or the ability to fuse
ancient and modern ideas into so good an imitation of the genuine
folk-story. In my judgement the construction of the legend is
practically proof of its genuinely popular origin.</p>

<p>Thus Eleusis and, in a lesser degree, the many places where
S. Demetrius has succeeded to the chief functions of Demeter
have hardly yet lost touch with the ancient worship of the
goddess, Christianised in form though it may be. But Arcadia too,
where alone of all the Peloponnese the indigenous population were
secure from the Achaean and Dorian immigrations and maintained
in seclusion the holiest of Pelasgian cults, preserves to the present
day in story and in custom some vestiges of the old religion; and
here they are less tinged with Christian colour.</p>

<p>Near the city of Pheneos, which according to Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> was
the scene of mysteries similar to those enacted at Eleusis, there are
some underground channels by which the waters of Lake Pheneos
are carried off, soon to reappear as the river Ladon. These channels
were believed by Pausanias himself to be artificial&mdash;the work of
Heracles, it was said, who also constructed a canal close by, traces
of which are still visible: but according to another authority<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
they were the passage by which Pluto carried off Persephone
to the infernal regions. Some memory of the latter belief seems
still to linger among the people of Phoniá (the modern form
of Pheneós), who call these subterranean vents <span class="greek">ἡ τρούπαις τοῦ
διαβόλου</span>, ‘the holes of the devil,’ and who further believe that it is
through them that the spirits of the dead pass to the lower world.
My guide informed me also that the rise or fall of the waters
of the lake&mdash;the level varies to an extraordinary degree&mdash;furnishes
an augury as to what rate of mortality may be expected in the
village. If the water is high, the lower world is for the time
being congested and requires no more inhabitants; if it sinks, the
lower world is empty, and thirsts for fresh victims. The connexion
of such beliefs with the cult of Persephone, though vague, is
probably real; but how general they may be among the present
villagers I cannot say; Dodwell<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> apparently heard nothing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
them except the name of ‘the devil’s holes,’ and the explanation
of this name which was given to him took the form of a story
about a conflict between the devil and a king of Phoniá, in which
the former hurled explosive balls of grease at his adversary, one
of which set him on fire and drove his body right through the
base of the mountain which rises from the lake’s edge, leaving
thereafter an escape for the waters. There is certainly nothing
in common between this story, which Leake also heard in a
slightly different version<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>, and the beliefs communicated to me;
and I suspect that it is a comparatively modern aetiological fable
designed perhaps to satisfy the curiosity of children concerning
the name. The belief that the subterranean channel is a descent
to the lower world is more clearly a vestige of the old local cult
of Kore.</p>

<p>Again in the neighbourhood of Phigalia there is current
among the peasantry a curious story which I tried in vain to
hear recited in full, but only obtained in outline at second-hand.
I cannot consequently vouch for its accuracy, but such as
it is I give it. There once were a brother and sister, of whom the
former was very wicked and a magician, while the latter was very
virtuous and beautiful. Her beauty was indeed so wonderful,
that her brother became enamoured of her. In her distress she
fled to a cave near Phigalia, hoping to elude his pursuit; but the
magician straightway discovered her. Then being at her wits’
end how to save herself from the unholy passion which her beauty
inspired, she prayed to be turned into some beast. Her prayer
was straightway granted, but the wicked magician had power to
change himself likewise. So when they had both been changed
into several shapes he at length overcame her. But no sooner
was the infamous deed done, than the Panagia caused an earthquake,
and the roof of the cave fell and destroyed both brother
and sister together.</p>

<p>A story of incest necessarily ends at the present day among
the highly moral countryfolk of Greece with punishment inflicted
by some Christian deity: but for the rest the story is practically
the same as that which Pausanias heard concerning Poseidon and
his sister Demeter in the same district<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. In the old version,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
which Pausanias gives very briefly, there is only one transformation
mentioned, that of Demeter into a mare and of Poseidon into
a horse; but it is at least noteworthy that the statue of horse-headed
Demeter which commemorated this incident is said to
have had ‘figures of snakes and other wild animals’ fixed on its
head; and possibly, if Pausanias had given a fuller version of the
myth, we should find that these figures related to other transformations
which Demeter had tried in vain before in equine form
she was finally forced to yield. The mention of the cave in the
modern story is also significant; for though the cave in the
ancient version is not the scene of the rape, it was there that
Demeter hid herself in her anger afterwards and there too that
the statue of horse-headed Demeter was set up. It would be
interesting to know whether the horse is one of the forms assumed
in the modern story; perhaps some other traveller will be fortunate
enough to hear the tale in full.</p>

<p>In northern Arcadia I also learnt that the flesh of the pig, in
respect of which the ordinary <i>Graeculus</i> fully deserves the epithet
<i>esuriens</i>, is taboo; and the result of eating it is believed to be
leprosy. It might be supposed that this superstition has resulted
from contact with Mohammedans; but such an explanation
would not account for the confinement of it to one locality&mdash;and
that a mountainous and unprofitable district where intercourse
with the Turks must have been small; and further the Greek
would surely have found a malicious pleasure, the most piquant
of sauces, in eating that which offended the two peoples whom
he most abhors, Turks and Jews. On the other hand, if
we suppose this fear of swine’s flesh to be a piece of native
tradition, its origin may well be sought in the ritual observances
of the old cult of Demeter and her daughter, to whom the pig was
sacred and in whose honour it was sacrificed once only in each
year, at the festival of the Thesmophoria<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. There are many
instances among different peoples of the belief that skin diseases,
especially leprosy, are the punishment visited upon those who
eat of the sacred or unclean animal; for the distinction between
sacred and unclean is not made until a primitive sense of awe is
inclined by conscious reasoning in the direction either of reverence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
or of abhorrence<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. Thus in Egypt, the land from which the
Pelasgians, if Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> might be believed, derived the worship
of Demeter, it was held that the drinker of pig’s milk incurred
leprosy<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>; and we may reasonably suppose that the same punishment
threatened those Egyptians who tasted of pig’s flesh save
at their one annual festival when this was enjoined<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. Now the
Thesmophoria resembled this Egyptian festival in that it was an
annual occasion for sacrificing pigs and for partaking therefore
of their flesh; if then the worshippers of Demeter, like the
Egyptians, were forbidden to use the pig for food at other
times, and if the penalty for disobedience in Greece too was
believed to be leprosy, the present case of taboo in Arcadia&mdash;the
only one known to me in modern Greece&mdash;may be a survival from
the ancient cult.</p>

<p>But apart from these traces of the worship of Demeter and
Kore in Christian worship, in folk-story, and in custom, traces
which constitute in themselves cogent proof of the firm hold on
the popular mind which the goddesses twain must long have kept,
there exists in the belief of the Greek peasantry a personal Power,
a living non-Christian deity, who still inspires awe in many simple
hearts and who may reasonably be identified with one or rather
perhaps with both of them.</p>

<p>For it must not be forgotten that the mother and the daughter
were in origin and symbolism one. The idea of life’s ebb and flow,
of nature’s sleeping and waking, is expressed in them severally as
well as conjointly. It would be impossible to analyse the complete
myth and, even if a purely physical interpretation were sought,
to express in physiological terms the two persons and the parts
which they play: for certain ideas find duplicate expression.
Either Demeter’s retirement to some dark cave or the descent
of Persephone to the underworld might have represented alone
and unaided the temporary abeyance of earth’s productive powers.
Yet it was with good reason that the myth expanded as it were
spontaneously until the spirit of life, that pervades not only the
cornfield but all that is animal and human too, was pourtrayed in
double form; not because the mere physical fact of the decay and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the revival of vegetation needed larger symbolism for its due
expression, but because in the tie of mother and daughter and
all that it connotes was fitly represented that by which the life-spirit
works among the higher orders of created things, that which
goes before life’s manifestations and outlasts its vanishings, the
spirit of love.</p>

<p>Of all such ideas as these the modern peasant, needless to say,
is wholly innocent. He has learnt from his ancestors of a woman
beautiful, reverend, deathless, who dwells within a mountain of
his land, and who by her dealings with mankind has proved her
real and divine puissance. Her name is no more uttered, perchance
because it is too holy for men of impure lips; they speak
only of ‘the Mistress.’ She is a real person, not the personification
of any natural force. The tiller of the land foresees his yearly
gain from cornfield and vineyard; the shepherd on the mountain-side
expects the yearly increase of his flock; but by neither is any
principle inferred therefrom, much less is such a principle personified;
the blessing which rests on field and fold is the work of a
living goddess’ hands. Flesh and blood she is, even as they themselves,
but immortal and very mighty, nobler than many of whom
the priests preach, stronger to help the good and to punish the
wicked. Simple people they are, who still believe such things,
and ignorant; yet less truly ignorant than some half-educated
pedants of the towns who vaunt their learning in chattering of
‘Ceres’ rather than of ‘Demeter’ and, misled by Roman versifiers
who at least had an excuse in the exigencies of metre, misinterpret
the name as a mere synonym for corn. Happily however the
influence of the schools&mdash;for it is amongst the schoolmasters that
the worst offenders in this respect are to be found&mdash;is not yet all-reaching,
and in the remoter villages tradition is still untainted.
There without fear of ridicule men may still confess their faith in
the great compassionate goddess.</p>

<p>It was in Aetolia that I first recognised the popular belief in
this deity. There I heard tell of one who was called <span class="greek">ἡ κυρὰ τοῦ
κόσμου</span>, ‘the mistress of the world.’ Her dwelling was in the
heart of a mountain, the means of access to it a cave, but
where situated, the peasants either did not know or feared to
tell. Her character indeed was ever gracious and kindly, but it
may be they thought she would resent a foreigner’s approach. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
her power was the granting of many boons, but her special care
was the fertility of the flocks and the abundance of the crops,
including in that district tobacco.</p>

<p>This revelation convinced me of the accuracy of what I had
previously suspected only in North Arcadia and in Messenia. In
both those regions I had heard occasional mention among the
peasants of one whose title was simply <span class="greek">ἡ δέσποινα</span>, ‘the Mistress.’
The word had always struck me as curious, for in ordinary usage
it is obsolete and the mistress of a house or whatever it may be
is always <span class="greek">ἡ κυρά</span> (i.e. <span class="greek">κυρία</span>). Knowing however that the Church
had preserved the title <span class="greek">ἡ δέσποινα</span> among those under which the
Virgin may be invoked, I was disposed at first to think that the
dedication of some church in the neighbourhood had influenced
the people to use the rare name <span class="greek">ἡ δέσποινα</span> instead of the
ordinary ‘Panagia.’ But when I enquired where the church of
‘the Mistress’ was, the answer was ‘she has none’: and yet, on
making subsequent enquiries of other persons, I found that there
was a church of the Panagia close by. Clearly then it was not in
the ecclesiastical sense that the title <span class="greek">ἡ δέσποινα</span> was being used.
More than this I failed to elicit&mdash;the peasants of the Peloponnese
are on the whole more suspicious and secretive than those of
northern Greece&mdash;but I have little doubt that this goddess is the
same as she who in Aetolia bears a title more colloquial in form
but identical in meaning.</p>

<p>The existence of this deity among the survivals of the old
religion has never, I think, been observed by any writer on the
subject of Greek folk-lore. But in Bernhard Schmidt’s collection
of popular stories and songs there is evidence, whose value he
himself did not recognise, to corroborate it. One of the songs<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
from Zacynthos contains the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ἔκαμ’ ὁ Θεὸς κι’ ἡ Παναγι̯ὰ κι’ ἡ Δέσποινα τοῦ κόσμου,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">καὶ ἐπολέμησα με Τούρκους, μ’ Ἀρβανίταις·</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">χίλιους ἔκοψα, χίλιους καὶ δυ̯ὸ χιλιάδες.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘They wrought in me, even God and the Virgin and the Mistress of the
world, and I fought with Turks and with Albanians: a thousand I slew, a
thousand yea and two thousand.’</p>
</div>

<p>The editor of this song omits from his translation and does not
even mention in his notes the last phrase of the first line, assum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>ing,
I suppose, that the Virgin is mentioned twice over under two
different titles; but it is at least possible that three persons are
intended. God and the Virgin belong to the category of Christian
deities; the third may be the pagan goddess already discovered in
Messenia, Arcadia, and Aetolia; if so, the collocation of her name
along with those of the highest Christian powers is strong testimony
to the reverence with which the people of Zacynthos too
were wont, and perhaps still continue, to regard her.</p>

<p>In Schmidt’s stories again yet another variation of the title
occurs. In one, which has already been narrated in full<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, ‘the
Mistress of the earth and of the sea’ (<span class="greek">ἡ κυρὰ τσῆ γῆς και τσῆ
θάλασσας</span>) rewards a poor man, on the recommendation of his good
angel, with miraculous gifts, and when he is slain by an envious
king, herself appears and sends down the tyrant quick into the
pit where punishment for his wickedness awaits him. Another,
in which the same ample appellation is used, runs in brief as
follows<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>:</p>

<p>‘Once upon a time a king on his return from a journey
gave to his eldest son as a present a picture of “the Mistress
of the earth and of the sea.” The prince was so dazzled by her
beauty that he resolved to seek her out and make her his wife.
He accordingly consulted a witch who told him how to find the
palace where the Mistress of earth and sea lived, and warned him
also that before he could secure the fulfilment of his desire two
tasks would be set him, the first to shatter a small phial carried
by a dove in its beak without injuring the bird, the second
to obtain the skin of a three-headed dragon. She also provided
him with a magic bow wherewith to perform the first labour,
and with two hairs from the dragon’s head, by means of which
he would be magically guided to the monster’s lair. Arrived
there he should glut it with a meal of earth which he was to
carry with him, and then slay it as it slept.</p>

<p>Thus forewarned and forearmed the prince set out and passing
through a cave, of which the witch had told him, came to the
palace. The Mistress having enquired of him his errand at
once set him to perform the two tasks. These he accomplished,
and she returned with him as his wife to his own land. But
they did not live peaceably together, and one day the Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
of earth and sea in her anger bade the waters overflow the whole
land, so that all mankind was drowned while she herself hovered
above in the air and looked on. Then when the waters subsided,
she descended to the earth and made new men by sowing
stones; and thereafter she ruled again as before over the whole
world.’</p>

<p>Both these stories hail, as does the song of which a few lines
are cited above, from Zacynthos, and there is therefore good reason
for believing that in that island the same ‘Mistress’ was recently
acknowledged as at this very day is venerated in those parts of
the mainland which I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Taking the common factors in these several traditions and
beliefs, we are led at once to identify the goddess to whom they
relate with Demeter.</p>

<p>First, the simplest form of her title, <span class="greek">ἡ δέσποινα</span>, of which
the others are merely elaborations, is that which Demeter commonly
shared with Persephone in old time; and that the title
has been handed down from antiquity is shown clearly by the fact
that the word is in ordinary usage obsolete. Since then it is
unlikely that in the course of tradition such a title should be
transferred (save, owing to Christian influence, in the case of the
Virgin, who has locally no doubt superseded one of the goddesses
twain and appropriated her byname), the word itself declares in
favour of the identification of this still living deity with Demeter.</p>

<p>Secondly, her dwelling-place is consistently in the modern
accounts the heart of a mountain, and the passage to it a cave.
Such precisely, according to Pausanias, was the habitation of
Demeter in Mt Elaïon<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; and the same idea is reflected in her
whole cult; for, though in the classical period she had temples
built like those of other deities, yet her holy of holies, as befitted
a Chthonian deity, was always a subterranean hall (<span class="greek">μέγαρον</span>) or
palace (<span class="greek">ἀνάκτορον</span>), an artificial and glorified cavern.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the modern deity is in character benevolent, therein
differing markedly from many of the pagan powers whom we
have yet to consider and also from several of the Christian
saints. Once only, in the second of the stories from Zacynthos,
does she appear in angry mood, when she destroys all mankind
by a flood. To the actual means of destruction employed too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
importance must not be attached. The <i>motif</i> of the flood is
common in modern Greek folk-tales. In the islands of the Aegean
I encountered it several times, the fullest version being one which
I heard in Scyros. The story as told there was exactly that of
Deucalion, save that in deference to biblical tradition he was
named Noah and, by a slight anachronism, it was the Panagia
instead of Themis who counselled him to create fresh men by
throwing stones over his shoulder. I was also taken to see the
place where the flood was at its highest, a narrow glen through
which runs a small stream, whose high sloping banks are certainly
a mass of half-fossilised animal and vegetable matter; and I was
escorted to the hill-top on which Noah’s caïque finally rested.
Such a theme is easily worked into a story of the deity, usually
benevolent though she be, who is ‘Mistress of the earth and of
the sea’; and apart from the means of punishment so appropriately
adopted by a goddess who rules the sea, this single
outburst of somewhat unreasonable anger on the part of the
modern deity against all mankind is singularly like the old-time
Demeter’s resentful retirement into the depths of her cave, until
‘all the produce of earth was failing and the human race was
perishing fast from famine<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.’ Yet otherwise the ancient goddess
too was benevolent and gracious to man.</p>

<p>Fourthly, in Aetolia at any rate and probably also in the
Peloponnese, where however I failed to extract definite information,
the modern goddess is the quickener of all the fruits of the
earth, and in functions therefore corresponds once more with
the ancient conception of Demeter. On these grounds the
identification seems to me certain.</p>

<p>This being granted, the permanence of tradition concerning
the dwelling-place of Demeter raises a question which I approach
with diffidence, feeling that an answer to it must rest with others
more competent than myself in matters archaeological. First, is
the tradition as old as that of the personality of the goddess? It
is hard to suppose otherwise; for the primitive mind would scarcely
conceive of a person without assigning also an habitation; and the
habitation actually assigned is of primitive enough character&mdash;a
cave in a mountain-side. Where then was Demeter worshipped
by the Pelasgians in the Mycenaean age? That she was a deity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
much reverenced by the dwellers in the Argive plain is certain;
small idols believed to represent Demeter Kourotrophos have
been found at Mycenae<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>; others, of which the identification is
more certain, at Tiryns<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>; and at Argos, in later times, Demeter
continued to be worshipped under the title Pelasgian<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>. Was
a mere cavern then her only home? Or did Mycenae lavish
some of its gold on building her a more worthy temple? May
not the famous bee-hive structures which have passed successively
for treasuries and for tombs of princes prove to be <span class="greek">μέγαρα</span>,
temples of Chthonian deities such as Demeter?</p>

<p>It is true that in some humbler structures of the same type,
such as those at Menídi and Thoricus, clear evidences of inhumation
have been found; but I question whether it is permissible to
draw from this fact the inference that those magnificent structures
also, the so-called Treasuries of Atreus and of Minyas, were in
reality tombs. It would seem reasonable to suppose that dwelling-places
for the dead beneath the earth and for earth-deities may
have been constructed on the same plan, but that the abodes
dedicated to immortals were more imposing than those destined
for dead men. This hypothesis appears to me more consistent
with the evidence of the actual sites at Mycenae and Orchomenos
than the commonly accepted view that the inner chamber of the
‘Treasury of Atreus’ was a place of burial. ‘In the centre of the
Mycenaean chamber,’ says Schuchhardt<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, ‘there is an almost
circular depression three feet in diameter and two feet in depth,
cut into the rocky ground. In spite of its unusual shape, we must
recognise in it the actual site of the grave.’ Was it a royal
posture to lie curled up like a cat? And if so, what of a similar
depression in the floor of the ‘Treasury of Minyas’ at Orchomenos?
‘Almost in the centre of the treasure-room’&mdash;I again quote
Schuchhardt<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>&mdash;‘was a long hole in the level rock, nine inches
deep, fifteen inches broad and nineteen inches long, which’&mdash;must
be recognised as the sepulchre of a royal baby? No, our
faith is not to be so severely taxed;&mdash;‘which must have served
to secure some monument.’ May we not, with more consistency,
extend the same explanation to Mycenae? And what then were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the monuments? May they not have been images of the deity
set up in the most natural place, the centre of the outer or the
inner sanctuary?</p>

<p>Again, the actual shape of the buildings is important. Ethnologists
tell us that it is ultimately derived from a type of dwelling
commonly occupied by primitive man, a circular wattle-hut with
conical top; or even more directly, as some would have it, from
a similarly shaped abode which the ancient Phrygians used to
excavate in the ground, constructing the top of withies laced over
beams converging to the apex and covered over with earth,
while they tunnelled out an approach from one side where the
ground sloped conveniently away<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. From this it is argued that
the domed chambers of Mycenae must be tombs, on the ground
that ‘men in all ages have fashioned the dwellings of the dead
in accordance with those of the living; but the dead are conservative,
and long after a new generation has sought a new home
and a new pattern for its houses, the habitations of the dead
are still constructed in ancestral fashion<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.’ I readily admit conservatism
in all religious matters; but how does the argument
touch Mycenae? Archaeologists, and among them Schuchhardt
himself<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, are agreed that the shaft-graves in the citadel are earlier
in date than the bee-hive structures of the lower town. There
was therefore a breach in the continuity of the ancestral fashion.
Reversion to a disused fashion is a very different thing from
conservatism in upholding an unbroken usage.</p>

<p>But even supposing that there were good evidence of the
uninterrupted continuity of this type of sepulchre, may not
the temples of Chthonian deities have been built on the same
plan? The use of the old word <span class="greek">μέγαρον</span> suggests that the
sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone, though subterranean, was
modelled on the dwellings of men, and, to borrow an argument,
religious conservatism may well have preserved for the gods’
abodes the hut-like shape of primitive man’s dwellings long after
a new type of house had become general among mortals. Concrete
instances of this actually existed in much later times<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. In Rome
the temple of Vesta was of this primitive shape, and so also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
most probably was the Prytaneum of Athens, which, though not
a temple, contained the sacred hearth of the whole community
and a statue of Hestia<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. Demeter then, as one of the deities of
primitive Greece, might well have been provided with a temple
constructed on the same primitive pattern as that of Vesta, but
subterranean, as would befit a Chthonian deity, and thus analogous
to the cave wherein she had been wont to dwell. The large
domed chamber would be her <i>megaron</i>, wherein her worshippers
assembled just as guests assembled in the <i>megaron</i> of a prince.
The small square apartment, where such exists, opening on one
side of the main room, might be the <span class="greek">παστάς</span> or ‘bedchamber,’ an
inner sanctuary which temples of later ages also possessed. The
approach or ‘dromos’ would represent the natural cave which
had given access to her fabled palace in the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>Finally, on such a view of these buildings, it would not be
difficult to explain Pausanias’ belief that they were treasuries<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.
Treasuries only, we may be sure, they were not; for they would
not have been built outside the walls of the citadel. But temples
in later times were used as depositories for treasure; the would-be
thief shrank apparently from the further crime of sacrilege; and
it is not unlikely that in a more primitive age, when superstitious
awe was certainly no less strong, while robbery far from being a
crime was an honourable calling, men should have secured their
treasure by storing it in some inviolable sanctuary. Indeed it
may be to such a custom that Homer alludes in speaking of
‘all that the stone threshold of the archer, even Phoebus Apollo,
doth enclose within at rocky Pytho<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.’ If then this practice
prevailed in Mycenaean, as it did in later, times, Pausanias would
be recording a tradition which was partially right; and it is not
hard to see how, when Mycenae’s greatness had suddenly, as it
seems, declined and her population perhaps had migrated for the
most part to Argos, later generations, familiar in their new
settlements with that different type of temple only which afterwards
became general, might have forgotten the sacred character
of the bee-hive structures and have remembered only the proverbial
wealth once stored by the kings of Mycenae within them.</p>

<p>There remains one point to which I may for the moment direct
attention here, reserving the development of the religious idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
contained in it for a later chapter. The main theme of the second of
the stories from Zacynthos was the seeking of the Mistress in marriage
by a young prince. Now if this story stood alone, it would not
be right to lay much stress upon it; for the adventures of a young
prince in search of some far-famed bride form the plot of numerous
Greek folk-tales; and it would be possible to suppose that the
real divine personality of the Mistress had been partially obscured
in the popular memory before such a story became connected
with her name. But the same <i>motif</i> as it happens is repeated
in two stories, one Greek and the other Albanian, in von Hahn’s
collection<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. The name of ‘the Mistress’ does not indeed occur;
the deity is called in both ‘the beautiful one of the earth<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.’ But
her identity is made quite clear in the Albanian story, which
evidently must have been borrowed from the Greek and is therefore
admissible as good evidence, by the mention of ‘a three-headed
dog that sleeps not day nor night’ by which she is
guarded. This is undoubtedly the same monster as the hero of
the Zacynthian story was required to kill&mdash;the three-headed
snake; and while the Albanian story, in making the beast a
guardian of the subterranean abode whom the adventurer must
slay before he can reach ‘the beautiful one,’ is better in construction
and, incidentally, more faithful to old tradition<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> than
the Greek version which makes the slaying an useless task
arbitrarily imposed, yet in both portraits of the monster we can
recognise Cerberus&mdash;half dog, half snake. But of him more
anon; ‘the beautiful one of the earth’ whom he guards can be
none other than Persephone.</p>

<p>Thus there are three modern stories which record the winning
of Demeter or Persephone in marriage by a mortal lover. Is this
a relic of ancient tradition? There was the attempt of Pirithous
to seize Persephone for his wife; but that failed, and moreover
was judged an impious deed for which he must suffer punishment.
Yet there is also the story of Iasion who was deemed worthy of
Demeter’s love. Wedlock then even with so great a deity as
Demeter or her daughter was not beyond mortals’ dream or reach.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Thus much I may notice now; when I come to examine more
closely the ancient worship of these goddesses, I shall argue that
the idea of a marriage-union between them and human kind was
the most intimate secret of the mysteries, and that in such folk-tales
as those which I have here mentioned is contained the germ
of a religious conception from which was once evolved the holiest
of ancient sacraments.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 6. <span class="smcap">Charon</span>.</h3>

</div>

<p>There is no ancient deity whose name is so frequently on the
lips of the modern peasant as that of Charon. The forms which
it has now assumed are two, <span class="greek">Χάρος</span> and <span class="greek">Χάροντας</span>, analogous to the
formations <span class="greek">γέρος</span> and <span class="greek">γέροντας</span> from the ancient <span class="greek">γέρων</span>: for in
late Greek at any rate the declension of <span class="greek">Χάρων</span> followed that
of <span class="greek">γέρων</span><a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. The two forms do not seem to belong to different
modern dialects, for they often appear in close juxtaposition in
the same folk-song. The shorter form however is the commoner
in every-day speech, and I shall therefore employ it.</p>

<p>About Charos the peasants will always, according to my
experience, converse freely. Neither superstitious awe nor fear
of ridicule imposes any restraint. They feel perhaps that the
existence of Charos is one of the stern facts which men must
face; and even the more educated classes retain sometimes, I
think, an instinctive fear of making light of his name, lest he
should assert his reality. For Charos is Death. He is not
now, what classical literature would have him to be, merely the
ferryman of the Styx. He is the god of death and of the lower
world.</p>

<p>Hades is no longer a person but a place, the realm over
which Charos rules. But the change which has befallen the
old monarch’s name is the only change in the Greek conception
of that realm. It is still called ‘the lower world’ (<span class="greek">ὁ κάτω κόσμος</span>
or <span class="greek">ἡ κάτω γῆ</span>), and even the name Tartarus (now <span class="greek">τὰ Τάρταρα</span>,
with the addition frequently of <span class="greek">τῆς γῆς</span>) still may be heard.
Nor is the character of the place altered. Its epithet ‘icy-cold,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
<span class="greek">κρυοπαγωμένος</span>, is well-nigh as constant in modern folk-songs
as was the equivalent <span class="greek">κρυερός</span> in Homer’s allusions to Hades’
house, while the picturesque word <span class="greek">ἀραχνιασμένος</span>, ‘thick with
spiders’-webs,’ repeats in thought the Homeric <span class="greek">εὐρωείς</span>, ‘mouldering.’
Such is Charos’ kingdom, and hither he conveys men’s souls
which he has snatched away from earth.</p>

<p>Here with him dwells his mother, a being, as one folk-song
tells<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>, more pitiful than he, who entreats him sometimes, when
he is setting out to the chase, to spare mothers with young
children and not to part lovers new-wed. He has also a wife,
Charóntissa or Chárissa, who as the name itself implies is merely
a feminine counterpart of himself without any distinct character
of her own. A son of Charos is also mentioned in song, for whose
wedding-feast ‘he slays children instead of lambs and brides as
fatlings<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>,’ and to whose keeping are entrusted the counter-keys
of Hades<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>. Adopted children are also counted among his family,
but these are of those whom he has carried from this world to
his own home<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. The household is completed by the three-headed
watch-dog, of whom however remembrance is very rare.
Yet in two stories in the last section we recognised Cerberus,
and even the less convincing of the embodiments there presented,
that which represented him as a three-headed snake
rather than dog, is not devoid of traces of ancient tradition.
The hero who would slay the monster has to cross a piece of
water&mdash;the sea instead of the river Styx&mdash;in order to reach an
island where is the monster’s lair; and there arrived, he sees
‘looking out from a hole three heads with eyes that flash fire
and jaws that breathe flames<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.’ This is Cerberus without doubt;
and if the story calls him ‘serpent’ rather than ‘dog,’ ancient
mythology and art alike justify in part the description; for his
mother was said to be Echidna, and he himself is found pourtrayed
with the tail of a serpent and a ring of snakes about his neck.
Schmidt himself appears to have overlooked the testimony of this
story and of that also from the collection of von Hahn in which,
as I have pointed out, we have a modern picture of Cerberus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
guarding the realm of Persephone; for he speaks of some remarkable
lines from a song which he himself heard in Zacynthos
as an unique mention of Cerberus, and questions the genuine
nature of the tradition. All doubt is however removed by the
corroborative evidence contained in the two stories already mentioned
and by the fact that a three-headed dog belonging to
Charos was recently heard of by a traveller in Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. The
lines themselves are put in the mouth of <span class="lock">Charos:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘A savage dog have I, who guards us all, and when he sees me he rages
and fain would devour me. A three-headed dog is he, and he burns like
fire; his claws are sharp and his tail is long; from his eyes he gives forth
flame and from his mouth burning heat; long is his tongue and grim his
teeth.’</p>
</div>

<p>Here at least recognition of Cerberus must be immediate;
every detail of the description, save for the characteristically
modern touch which makes Charos afraid of his own dog, is in
accord with classical tradition.</p>

<p>Such is the household of Charos, so far as a description may
be compiled from a few scattered allusions; his own portrait
varies more, in proportion as there are more numerous attempts
in every part of Greece to draw it. Sometimes he is depicted
as an old man, tall and spare, white of hair and harsh of feature;
but more often he is a lusty warrior, with locks of raven-black
or gleaming gold&mdash;just as Hades in old time was sometimes
<span class="greek">κυανοχαίτης</span>, sometimes <span class="greek">ξανθός</span>,&mdash;who rides forth on his black
steed by highway or lonely path to slay and to ravage: ‘his
glance is as lightning and his face as fire, his shoulders are like
twin mountains and his head like a tower<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.’ His raiment is
usually black as befits the lord of death, but anon it is depicted
bright as his sunlit hair<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>, for though he brings death he is a god
and glorious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p>His functions are clearly defined. He visits this upper world
to carry off those whose allotted time has run, and guards them
in the lower world as in a prison whose keys they vainly essay
to steal and to escape therefrom. But the spirit in which he
performs those duties varies according as he is conceived to be
a free agent responsible to none or merely a minister of the
supreme God. Which of these is the true conception is a
question to which the common-folk as a whole have given no final
answer; and the character of Charos consequently depends upon
the view locally preferred.</p>

<p>Those who regard him as simply the servant and messenger
of God, find no difficulty in accommodating him to his Christian
surroundings; for, as I have said, the peasant does not distinguish
between the Christian and the pagan elements in his faith which
together make his polytheism so luxuriant. We have already
seen Charos’ name with the prefix of ‘saint<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>’; and though this
Christian title is not often accorded him, yet his name appears
commonly on tomb-stones in Christian churchyards. At Leonídi,
on the east coast of the Peloponnese, I noted the couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">καὶ μένα δὲν λυπήθηκε ὁ Χάρος νά με πάρῃ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ποῦ εἴμουνα τοῦ οἴκου μου μονάκριβο βλαστάρι.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Me too Charos pitied not but took, even me the fondly-cherished flower
of my home.’</p>
</div>

<p>So too in popular story and song he is represented as
working in concord with the Angels and Archangels, to whom
sometimes falls the task of carrying children to his realm<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.
Indeed one of the archangels, Michael, who as we saw above has
ousted Hermes, the escorter of souls, and assumed his functions,
is charged with exactly the same duties as Charos in the conveyance
of men’s souls to the nether world, so that in popular
parlance the phrases ‘he is wrestling with Charos’ (<span class="greek">παλεύει μὲ
τὸ Χάρο</span>)<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and ‘he is struggling with an angel’ (<span class="greek">ἀγγελομαχεῖ</span>)<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
are both alike used of a man in his death-agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p>This Christianised conception of Charos has not been without
influence in softening the lines of the character popularly ascribed
to him. The duties imposed upon him by the will of God are
sometimes repugnant to him, and he would willingly spare those
whom he is sent to slay. One folk-story related to me exhibits
him even as a friend of <span class="lock">man:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘Once upon a time there were a man and wife who had had
seven children all of whom died in infancy. When an eighth was
born, the father betook himself to a witch and enquired of her
how he might best secure the boy’s life. She told him that the
others had died because he had chosen unsuitable godparents,
and bade him on this occasion ask the first man whom he should
meet on his way home to stand sponsor for the child. He accordingly
departed, and straightway met a stranger riding on a black
horse, and made his request to him. The stranger consented,
and the baptism at once took place; but no sooner was it over
than he was gone without so much as telling his name.</p>

<p>Ten years passed, and the child was growing up strong and
healthy. Then at last the father again encountered the unknown
stranger, and reproached him with having been absent so long
without ever making enquiry after his godson. Then the stranger
answered, “Better for thee if I had not now come and if thou
neededst not now learn my name. I am Charos, and because
I am thy friend<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, am come to warn thee that thy days are well-nigh
spent.” Thereupon Charos led him away to a cave in the
mountain-side, and they entered and came to a chamber where
were many candles burning. Then said Charos, “See, these
candles are the lives of men, and yonder are thine and thy
son’s.” Then the man looked, and of his own candle there were
but two inches left, but his son’s was tall and burnt but slowly.
Then he besought Charos to light yet another candle for him ere
his own were burnt away, but Charos made answer that that could
not be. Then again he besought him to give him ten years from
the life of his son, for he was a poor man, and if he died ere his
son were grown to manhood, his widow and orphan would be in
want. But Charos answered, “In no way can the decreed length
of life be changed. Yet will I show thee how in the two years that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
yet remain to thee thou mayest enrich thyself and leave abundant
store for thy wife and child. Thou shalt become a physician. It
matters not that thou knowest nought of medicine, for I will give
thee a better knowledge than of drugs. Thine eyes shall ever be
open to see me; and when thou goest to a sick man’s couch, if
thou dost see me standing at the bed-head, know then that he
must die, and say to them that summoned thee that no skill can
save him; but if thou dost see me at the foot of the bed, know
that he will recover; give him therefore but pills of bread if thou
wilt, and promise to restore him.” Then did the man thank
Charos, and went away to his home.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the only daughter of the king lay
grievously sick, and all the doctors and magicians had been
called to heal her, but they availed nothing. Then came the
poor man whom Charos had taught, and went into the room
where the princess lay, and lo! Charos stood at the foot of her
bed. Then he bade the king send away the other physicians,
for that he alone could heal her. So he himself went home
and mixed flour and water and came again and gave it to the
king’s daughter, and soon she was recovered of her sickness. Then
the king gave him a great present, and his fame was spread
abroad, and many resorted to him, and soon he was rich.</p>

<p>Thus two years passed, and at the end thereof he himself lay
sick. And he looked and saw Charos standing at the head of
his bed. Then he bade his wife turn the bed about, but it availed
nothing; for Charos again stood at his head, and caught him by
the hair, and he opened his mouth to cry out, and Charos drew
forth his soul<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.’</p>

<p>Again the unwillingness of Charos to execute the harsh
decrees of God is illustrated in numerous folk-songs. Most often
it is some brave youth, shepherd or warrior, a lover of the open
air, who excites his compassion; for the same notes of regret
which Sophocles made melodious in the farewell of Ajax to the
sunlight, to his house in Salamis, even to the streams and springs
of the Trojan land which brought his death, ring clear and true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
in modern folk-song too from the lips of dying warriors. Such
were the last words of the outlaw-patriot (<span class="greek">κλέφτης</span>) Zedros:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Farewell, Olympus, now farewell, and all the mountain-summits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell, my strongholds desolate, and plane-trees rich in shadow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye fountains with your waters cool, and level plains low-lying.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell I bid the swift-winged hawks<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, farewell the royal eagles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell for me the sun I love and the bright-glancing moonlight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That lighted up my path wherein to walk a warrior worthy<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such laments are not lost upon Charos, the servant of God, but
he must needs turn a deaf ear to prayers for a respite. Clear
and final comes his answer, almost in the same words in every
ballad<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘No respite can I give, brave sir, for I am straitly chargèd;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis God that sent me here to thee, sent me to take thy spirit.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes then the doomed man will seek to tempt Charos with
meat and drink, that he may grant a few hours’ delay, but against
offers of hospitality he is obdurate. Or again his victim refuses
to yield to death ‘without weakness or sickness’ and challenges
him to a trial of athletic skill, in wrestling or leaping, whereon
each shall stake his own soul. And to this Charos sometimes
gives consent, for he knows that he will win. So they make
their way to the ‘marble-paved threshing-floor,’ the arena of all
manly pursuits; and there the man perchance leaps forty cubits,
yet Charos surpasses him by five; or they wrestle together from
morn till eve, but at the last bout Charos is victor. One hero
indeed is known to fame, whose exploits make him the Heracles
of modern Greece, Digenes the Cyprian, who wrestled with
Charos for three nights and days and was not vanquished. But
then ‘there came a voice from God and from the Archangels,
“Charos, I sent thee not to engage in wrestlings, but that thou
should’st carry off souls for me<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.”’ And at that rebuke Charos
transformed himself into an eagle and alighted on the hero’s
head and plucked out his soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p>The other and more pagan conception of Charos excludes all
traits of kindness and mercy; and men do not stint the expression
of their hatred of him. He is ‘black,’ ‘bitter,’ ‘hateful’ (<span class="greek">μαῦρος<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>,
πικρός, στυγερός</span>). He is the merciless potentate of the nether
world, independent of the God of heaven, equally powerful in his
own domain, but more terrible, more inexorable: for his work is
death and his abode is Hades. Thence he issues forth at will, as
a hunter to the chase. ‘Against the wounds that Charos deals
herbs avail not, physicians give no cure, nor saints protection<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.’
His quarry is the soul of man; ‘where he finds three, he takes
two of them, and where he finds two, takes one, and where he
finds but one alone, him too he takes<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.’ Sometimes he is enlarging
his palace, and he takes the young and strong to be its
pillars; sometimes he is repairing the tent in which he dwells,
and uses the stout arms of heroes for tent-pegs and the tresses
of bright-haired maidens for the ropes; sometimes he is laying
out a garden, and he gathers children from the earth to be the
flowers of it and young men to be its tall slim cypresses; more
rarely he is a vintager, and tramples men in his vat that their
blood may be his red wine, or again he carries a sickle and reaps
a human harvest.</p>

<p>But most commonly he is the warrior preëminent in all
manner of prowess&mdash;archer, wrestler, horseman. Once a bride
boasted that she had no fear of Charos, for that her brothers
were men of valour and her husband a hero; then came Charos
and shot an arrow at her, and her beauty faded; a second and
a third arrow, and he stretched her on her death-bed<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. Often in
the pride of strength have young warriors laughed Charos to
scorn; then has he come to seize the strongest of them, and
though the warrior strain and struggle as in a wrestling-match,
yet Charos wearies not but wins the contest by fair means or
foul: for he is no honourable foe, but dishonest above thieves,
more deceitful than women<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>: he seizes his adversary by the hair
and drags him down to Hades. Even more striking is the picture
of Charos as horseman riding forth on his black steed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
foray, and it is this conception which has inspired one of the
finest achievements of the popular <span class="lock">muse:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Such is the more pagan presentment of the modern Charos, a
tyrant as absolute in his own realm as God in heaven, a veritable
<span class="greek">Ζεὺς ἄλλος</span><a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> as was Hades of old, but hard of heart, heedless of
prayer, delighting in cruelty.</p>

<p>At first sight then the Charos of modern Greece would seem
to have little in common with the Charon of ancient Greece
beyond the name and some connexion with death: and Fauriel, in
the introduction to his collection of popular songs, pronounces
the opinion that in this case the usual tendencies of tradition
have been reversed, in that it is the name that has survived,
while the attributes have been changed<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. To this judgement I
cannot subscribe. I suspect that in ancient times the literary
presentation of Charon was far more circumscribed than the
popular, and that out of a profusion of imaginative portraitures
as varied as those seen in the folk-songs of to-day one aspect of
Charon became accepted among educated men as the correct and
fashionable presentment. Hades was, in literature, the despot of
the lower world, and for Charon no place could be found save that
of ferryman. But this, I think, was only one out of the many
guises in which the ancient Charon was figured by popular
imagination; for at the present day the remnants of such a
conception are small, in spite of the fact that there has remained
a custom which should have kept it alive&mdash;the custom of putting
a coin in the mouth of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>Only in one folk-song, recorded from Zacynthos, can I find
the old literary representation of Charon as ferryman of the
Styx unmistakably reproduced. The following is a literal rendering:&mdash;‘Across
the river that none may ford Charos was passing,
and one soul was on the bank and gave him greeting. “Good
Charos, long life to thee, well-beloved; take me, even me, with
thee, take me, dear Charos! A poor man’s soul was I, even of a
poor man and a beggar; men left me destitute and I perished for
lack of a crumb of barley-bread. No last rites did they give me,
they gave me none, poor soul, not even a farthing in my mouth
for thee who dost await me. Poor were my children, poor and
without hope; destitute were they and lay in death unburied,
poor souls. Them thou did’st take, good Charos, them thou
did’st take, I saw thee, when thy cold hand seized them by the
hair. Take me too, Charos, take me, take me, poor soul; take
me yonder, take me yonder, no other waiteth for thee.” Thus
cried to him the poor man’s soul, and Charos made answer,
“Come, soul, thou art good, and God hath pitied thee.” Then
took he the soul and set her on the other bank, and spreading
then his sail he sped far away<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.’</p>

<p>In another song<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> of the same collection, hailing also from
Zacynthos, there may be a reminiscence of the same old tradition.
In it Charos has a caïque with black sails and black oars and goes
to and fro&mdash;whence and whither is not told&mdash;with cargoes of the
dead. But more probably the imagery is borrowed from seafaring;
the Greek peasant would hardly imagine a caïque plying on a
river; the streams of his own country will seldom carry even a
small bark. A sea-voyage on the other hand is, especially in the
imagination of islanders, the most natural method of departure
to a far-off country. From the sea certainly comes the metaphor
in a funeral dirge from Zacynthos in which the mourner asks of
the dead,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="greek">σὲ τὶ καράβι θὰ βρεθῇς καὶ ’σ τὶ πόρτο θ’ ἀράξῃς</span>;<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘In what boat wilt thou be and at what haven wilt thou land?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This too is claimed by Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> as a reminiscence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Charon’s ferry&mdash;somewhat unfortunately; for the next line
continues,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="greek">γιὰ νἄρθῃ ἡ μανοῦλα σου νά σε ξαναγοράσῃ</span>,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘That thy mother may come and ransom thee again.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now in another dirge<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> also heard by Schmidt in the same
island, this idea is worked out even more fully: the mother cries
to the master of the ship that bears away her lost son not to sell
him, and offers high ransom for him; but the dead man in answer
bids her keep her treasure; ‘not till the crow doth whiten and
become a dove, must thou, mother mine, look for me again.’
Clearly the imagery is borrowed not from the ferry-boat of Charon
plying for hire, but from a descent of pirates who carry men off
to hold them to ransom or to sell them for slaves. In neither
dirge is Charos actually named, but doubtless he is understood
to be the captain of the pirates; for in more than one dirge of
Laconia and Maina he is explicitly called <span class="greek">κουρσάρος</span>, a corsair<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.</p>

<p>Here then we have yet another presentation of the modern
Charos; but of Charon the ferryman there is no sure remembrance
except in one song from Zacynthos. Nor again, save in
that one song, is the river of death imagined as an impassable
barrier; it is rather a stream of Lethe: no boatman is
needed to carry the dead across; but mention is made only of
‘the loved ones, that pass the river and drink the water thereof,
and forget their homes and their orphan children<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>’&mdash;just as in
the mountains there are ‘springs in marble grots, whereat the wild
sheep drink and remember no more their lambs<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.’ It is the
drinking of the water, not the passing of the stream, which frees
the dead from aching memories: the picture is wholly different
from that of a river which cannot be crossed but by grace of
the ferryman.</p>

<p>The general oblivion into which the ancient conception of
Charon has fallen is the more remarkable, as I have said, in view
of the survival of a custom which in antiquity was closely associated
with it. In parts of Macedonia, Thrace, and Asia Minor the practice
prevails<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>, or till recently prevailed, of placing in the mouth (or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
more rarely on the breast) of the dead a small coin, which in
the environs of Smyrna is actually known as <span class="greek">τὸ περατίκι</span>, passage-money<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.
In the Cyclades and in parts of the Greek mainland
I myself have met aged persons who could recall the existence
of the custom: a century or two ago it was probably frequent.
But there is less evidence that the coin was commonly intended
for Charos. Protodikos indeed, the authority for the existence of
the custom in Asia Minor, writing in 1860, says expressly that
the coin was designed for Charos as ferryman; and the name of
‘passage-money’ locally given to the coin tends to confirm the
statement of a writer whom I have found in some other matters
inaccurate. Another authority<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> moreover, writing also in 1860,
states that at Stenimachos in Thrace ‘until a short time ago’ the
coin was laid in the mouth of the dead actually for Charos; nor
can there be any question that the classical interpretation of
the custom survived long in Zacynthos, as is evidenced by the
complaint of the poor man’s soul in the song translated above,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">’στερνὰ ἐμὲ δὲ μοὔδωκαν, δε μοὔδωκαν τσῆ καϋμένης,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">μήτε λεφτὸ ’στὸ στόμα μου γιὰ σὲ ποῦ περιμένεις,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘No last rites did they give me, they gave me none, poor soul, not even
a farthing in my mouth for thee (Charos) who awaitest me.’</p>
</div>

<p>Yet Schmidt, who recorded these lines from Zacynthos, found that
the actual custom was barely remembered there. He met indeed,
in 1863, one old woman aged eighty-two, who as a child had
known the practice of putting a copper in the mouth of the dead
as also that of laying a key on the corpse’s breast; but of the
purpose of the coin she knew nothing; the key she believed to
be useful for opening the gates of Paradise. For myself, though
I have heard mention of the use of the coin, I have never known
it to be associated with Charos. I incline therefore to the opinion
that in most places where the custom is or has recently been
practised, it has outlived the interpretation which was in classical
times put upon it.</p>

<p>But was the classical interpretation a true index to the
origin of the custom? Was it anything more than an aetiological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
explanation of a custom whose significance even in an early
age had already become obscured by lapse of time? One thing
at least has been made certain by the modern study of folklore,
namely that a custom may outlive not only the idea which gave it
birth but even successive false ideas which it has itself engendered
in the minds of men who have sought vainly to explain it. When
therefore Lucian<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> stated that ‘they put an obol in the dead man’s
mouth as boat-fare for the ferryman,’ it is possible that he was
recording a late and incorrect interpretation of a custom which
had existed before the rôle of ferryman had ever been invented
for Charon. Further if that interpretation had been in the main
a literary figment, it would have been natural for the original
meaning of the custom to be still remembered among the unlettered
common-folk of outlying districts. There are plenty of
cases in modern Greece in which different explanations of the
same custom are offered in different localities. In spite therefore
of the fact that one view only found expression in classical
literature, there is no antecedent improbability in the supposition
that an older view may have been handed down even to recent
generations in the purer oral traditions of the common-folk.</p>

<p>Once only, from a fellow-traveller in the Cyclades, did I obtain
any explanation at all of the use of the coin, <span class="greek">εἶναι καλὸ γιὰ
τἀερικά</span><a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, ‘it is useful because of the aërial ones.’ This sounds
vague enough, but nothing more save gestures of uncertainty
could I elicit. Was the coin useful, in his view, as a fee to
be paid to ‘the aërial ones’ on the soul’s journey from this
world to the next, or as a charm against the assaults of such
beings? That was the question to which I sought an answer
from him, but in vain. For myself I cannot determine in which
sense the dark saying was actually meant. The former would
accord well with one local belief of the present day, if only my
informant had specified one particular kind of aërial beings who
are believed to take toll of departing souls; but to this I shall
return in a later section of this chapter<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. The second interpretation
of the words, however, whether they were intended in that
sense by the speaker or not, furnishes what will be shown by
other evidence to be the key to the origin of the custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>A coin is often used as a charm against sinister influences<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.
In this case then it may have been a prophylactic against aërial
spirits. Why then is it generally put in the dead man’s mouth?
Not, I think, because the mouth is a convenient purse, as seems
to be assumed in the classical interpretation of the custom, but
because the mouth is the entrance to the body. The peasants
of to-day believe as firmly as men of the Homeric age that it
is through the mouth that the soul escapes at death. The phrase
<span class="greek">μὲ τὴ ψυχὴ ’στὰ δόντια</span>, ‘with the soul between the teeth,’
is the popular equivalent for ‘at the last gasp’; and in the folk-songs
the same idea constantly recurs; ‘open thy mouth,’ says
Charos to a shepherd whom he has thrown in wrestling, ‘open thy
mouth that I may take thy soul<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.’ Now the passage by which the
soul makes its exit, is naturally the passage by which evil spirits
(or the soul<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, if it should return,) would make their entrance; and,
as we shall see later, there is a very real fear among the peasantry
that a dead body may be entered and possessed by an evil spirit.
Clearly then the mouth, by which the spirit would enter, is the
right place in which to lay the protective coin.</p>

<p>The interpretation which I suggest gains support from some
points in modern usage. In Macedonia, according to one traveller<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>,
the coin which formerly used to be laid in the corpse’s mouth was
Turkish and bore a text from the Koran, an aggravation of the
pagan custom which was made a pretext for episcopal intervention<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.
Now clearly, if the coin had in that district been designed as
payment for the services of Charos as ferryman, there would have
been no motive for preferring one bearing an inscription from the
Mohammedan scriptures, which assuredly could not enhance the
coin’s value in the eyes of Charos: but if the coin was itself
employed as a charm against evil spirits, the sacred text might
well have been deemed to add not a little to its prophylactic
properties. Thus the character of the particular type of coin
chosen indicates that the coin in itself too was at one time viewed
as a charm; a charm moreover whose effect would be precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
that of the key which in the island of Zacynthos was also laid
upon the dead man’s breast; for the key was certainly not designed,
as Schmidt’s informant would have it, to open the gates of
Paradise, but, like any other piece of iron, served originally to
scare away spirits. The use of a coin as well as of a key in that
island was merely meant to make assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p>Again, in many places throughout Greece, where this use of
a coin is no longer known, a substitute of more Christian character
has been found. On the lips of the dead is laid either a morsel of
consecrated bread from the Eucharist<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, or more commonly a small
piece of pottery&mdash;a fragment it may be of any earthenware
vessel&mdash;on which is incised the sign of the cross with the legend
<span class="greek">Ι. Χ. ΝΙ. ΚΑ.</span> (‘Jesus Christ conquers’) in the four angles<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. Here
the choice of the inscribed words of itself seems to indicate the
intention of barring the dead man’s mouth against the entrance of
evil spirits; and as final proof of my theory I find that in both
Chios<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, where a wholly or partially Christianised
form of the custom prevails, the charm employed is definitely
understood by the people to be a means of precaution against
a devil entering the dead body and resuscitating it. Nor must
the mention of a devil in this connexion be taken as evidence
that the Chian and Rhodian interpretation of the custom is not
ancient. I shall be able to show in a later chapter that the idea
of a devil entering the corpse is only the Christian version of a
pagan belief in a possible re-animation of the corpse by the soul<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>But there is yet another variety of the custom, in which no
coin and no Mohammedan nor Christian<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> symbol is used, but
a charm whose magic properties were in repute long before
Mohammed, long before Christ, probably long before coinage was
known to Greece. Again a piece of pottery is used, but the
symbol stamped upon it is the geometrical figure <img class="inline" src="images/pentagram.png" alt="pentagram" />, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
‘pentacle’ of mediaeval magic lore. In Greece it is now known as
<span class="greek">τὸ πεντάλφα</span>, but of its properties, beyond the fact that it serves
as a charm<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>, the people have nothing to say. In the mediaeval
and probably in the yet earlier magic of Europe and the East it is
one of the commonest figures, appearing sometimes as Solomon’s
seal, sometimes as the star which led the wise men to Bethlehem,
sometimes, in black colouring, as a symbol of the principle of evil,
and correspondingly, in white, as the symbol of the principle of
good. But though the figure has been known to the magicians of
many nations and many epochs, there is no reason to suppose that
it is in recent times or from other races that the Greeks have
learnt it: for it was known too by the ancient Greeks, who noted
among its more intelligible properties the fact that the five lines
composing it can be drawn without removing pencil from paper.
The Pythagoreans, who called it the <span class="greek">πεντάγραμμον</span><a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>, are known to
have attached to it some mystic value. There is a reasonable
likelihood therefore that the symbol has been handed down in
Greece as a magical charm&mdash;for we have seen how many other
methods of magic have survived&mdash;from the time of Pythagoras.
Further back we cannot penetrate; yet&mdash;<i>vixere fortes ante
Agamemnona</i>, and there were professors of occult sciences before
Pythagoras. Was it then he who first discovered the figure’s
mystic value? Or did he merely adopt and interpret in his own
way a symbol which for long ages before him had been endowed
with magical powers? Was it perhaps this figure, graven on
some broken potsherd, which long before coinage supplied a
more ready charm protected the corpse from possession by evil
spirits, or rather, in those days, from reanimation by the soul?
Who shall say? The belief, which has found its modern expression
in the engraving of Christian or Mohammedan texts
on prophylactic coins or pottery and in barring with them the
door of the lips which gives access to the corpse, is certainly
primitive enough in character to date from the dimmest prehistoric
age.</p>

<p>If my suggestion as to the origin of the custom is correct,
it was only the accident of a coin being commonly used as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
prophylactic charm, which caused the classical association of the
custom with Charon; and, once disembarrassed of this association,
the popular conception of Charon in antiquity is more easily
studied.</p>

<p>The literary presentation of him in the guise of a ferryman
only is a comparatively late development. The early poets know
nothing of him whatever in any character. The first literary
reference to him was apparently in the <i>Minyad</i>, an epic poem of
doubtful but not early date, of which two lines referring to the
descent of Theseus and Pirithous to the lower world ran thus:
‘There verily the ship whereon the dead embark, even that which
the aged Charon as ferryman doth guide, they found not at its
anchorage<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.’ These are the lines by which Pausanias believed that
Polygnotus had been guided when painting the figure of Charon
in his famous representation of the nether world at Delphi.
Thenceforth this was the one orthodox presentation of Charon in
both literature and art. Euripides and Aristophanes in numerous
passages<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> both alike conform to it, and the painters of funeral
vases were equally faithful.</p>

<p>But there is evidence to show that this was not the popular
conception of Charon, or at any rate not the whole of it. Phrases
occur (and were probably current in classical times) which seem
to imply a larger conception of Charon’s office and functions. The
‘door of Charon’ (<span class="greek">Χαρώνειος θύρα</span><a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> or <span class="greek">Χαρώνειον</span><a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>) was that by
which condemned prisoners were led out to execution. The
‘staircase of Charon’ (<span class="greek">Χαρώνειος κλίμαξ</span><a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>) was that by which
ghosts in drama ascended to the stage, as if they were appearing
from the nether world. To Charon likewise were ascribed in
popular parlance many caverns of forbidding aspect, particularly
those that were filled with mephitic vapours&mdash;<span class="greek">Χαρώνεια βάραθρα<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>,
σπήλαια<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, ἄντρα<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span>. Finally <span class="greek">Χαρωνῖται</span> is Plutarch’s<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> rendering of
the Latin <i>Orcini</i>, the <i>sobriquet</i> given to the low persons whom
Caesar brought up into the Senate. These uses point to a popular
conception of Charon larger than classical art and literature reveal,
and justify Suidas’ simple identification of Charon with death<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>Moreover once in Euripides, for all his strict adherence to
the conventional literary characterisation of Charon, a glimpse of
popular thought is reflected in the person of Death (<span class="greek">Θάνατος</span>) and
the part which he plays in the <i>Alcestis</i>. First, in the altercation
between Apollo and Death over the fate of Alcestis, there occur
the words, ‘Take her and go thy way; for I know not whether
I should persuade thee’; to which Death answers, ‘Persuade me to
slay those whom I must? nay, ’tis with this that I am charged’
(<span class="greek">τοῦτο γὰρ τετάγμεθα</span><a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>). Can it be a mere coincidence that, in
modern folk-song, when some doomed man seeks to persuade
Charos to grant a respite, he answers, ‘Nay, brave sir, I cannot;
for I am straitly charged’? The very word ‘charged,’ <span class="greek">προσταμμένος</span>,
the modern form of <span class="greek">προστεταγμένος</span>, repeats the word placed
by Euripides in the mouth of Death. Secondly, Death appears
in warrior-guise, just as does Charos most commonly in modern
folk-songs; he is girt with a sword<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>, and it is by wrestling<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> that
Heracles vanquishes him and makes him yield up his prey. Is
this again a mere coincidence? Or was Euripides, in his personification
of Death, utilising the character popularly assigned to
Charon? It looks indeed in one line as if the poet had almost
forgotten that he was not using the popular name also; otherwise
there is no excuse for the inelegance of making Death inflict
death<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. It is hardly surprising that the copyist of one<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> of the
extant manuscripts of the <i>Alcestis</i> was so impressed with the
likeness of Death to Charon as he knew him, that he altered
the name of the <i>dramatis persona</i> accordingly.</p>

<p>In the Anthology again Charon appears several times<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> acting
in a more extended capacity than that of ferryman; as in modern
folk-songs, he actually seizes men and carries them off to the
nether world. One epigram is particularly noticeable as seeming
to have been suggested by a passage of the <i>Alcestis</i>. ‘Is there
then any way whereby Alcestis might come unto old age?’ asks
Apollo; and Death answers, ‘There is none; I too must have the
pleasure of my dues.’ ‘Yet,’ says Apollo, ‘thou wilt not get more
than the one soul,’&mdash;be it now or later. And similarly the epigram
from the Anthology, save that Death is frankly named Charon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
‘Charon ever insatiable, why hast thou snatched away Attalus
needlessly in his youth? Was he not thine, an he had died old?’</p>

<p>Clearly, it would seem, Euripides knew a popular conception of
Charon other than that which literary and artistic tradition had
crystallised as the orthodox presentation, but rather than break
through the conventions by bringing Charon on the stage otherwise
than as ferryman, he had recourse to a purely artificial
personification of death.</p>

<p>But the conception of Charon as lord of death can be traced
yet further back than the time of Euripides. Hesychius states
that the title <span class="greek">Ἀκμονίδης</span><a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> was shared by two gods, Charon and
Uranus. Charon therefore, as son of Acmon and brother of
Uranus, is earlier by two long generations of gods than Zeus
himself, and belongs to the old Pelasgian order of deities. Was
Charon then the god of death among the old Pelasgian population
of Greece, before ever the name of Hades or Pluto had been
invented or imported? Yes, if the corroboration from another
Pelasgian source, the Etruscans, is to count for anything. On
an Etruscan monument figures the god of death with the inscription
‘Charun’<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>; and the same person is frequently depicted on
urns, sarcophagi, and vases<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. Usually the door of the nether
world is to be seen behind him; either he is issuing forth to seek
his prey, or he is about to enter there with a victim who stands
close beside him, his hand clasped in that of wife or friend to
whom he bids farewell<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. In appearance he is most often an
old bearded man (though a more youthful type is also known)
bearing an axe or mallet, and more rarely a sword as well, wherewith
he pursues men and slays them<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>. In effect the Etruscan
Charun closely corresponds with the modern Greek Charos in
functions as well as in name. The coincidence allows of one explanation
only. The Greeks of the present day must have inherited
their idea of Charos from ancestors who were closely connected
with the Etruscans and to whom Charon was the god of death who
came to seize men’s souls and carry them off to his realm in
the nether world. These ancestors can only have been the
original Pelasgian population of Greece. In classical times the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
primitive conception of Charon was in abeyance. Hades had
assumed the reins of government in the nether world; and a
literary legend, which confined Charon to the work of ferryman,
had gained vogue and supplanted or rather temporarily suppressed
the older conception. But this version, it appears, never
gained complete mastery of the popular imagination, and to
the common-folk of Greece from the Pelasgian era down to this
day Charon has ever been more warrior than ferryman, and his
equipment an axe or sword or bow rather than a pair of sculls.
More is to be learnt of the real Charon of antiquity from modern
folk-lore than from all the allusions of classical literature.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 7. <span class="smcap">Aphrodite and Eros.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In the story of S. Demetra communicated to Lenormant at
Eleusis and narrated above, we have already had one instance of
the preservation of Aphrodite’s name. ‘Since the lady Aphrodite
(<span class="greek">ἡ κυρὰ ‘φροδίτη</span>) none had been seen so lovely’ as S. Demetra’s
daughter. Another story related to Perrot<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> by an Attic peasant in
the year 1858 contains both the name of the goddess and some
reminiscences of her worship. The gist of it is as follows. There
once was a very beautiful queen, by name Aphrodite, who had
a castle at Daphni (just half-way on the road from Athens to
Eleusis) and also owned the heights of Acro-Corinth; these two
places she had caused to be connected by a subterranean way
which passed under the sea. Now there were two kings both
of whom were smitten with her beauty and sought her hand in
marriage. She herself favoured one of them and hated the other;
but not wishing to declare her preference and so arouse the anger
of the rejected suitor, she announced that she was about to build
a palace on the height of Acro-Corinth, and would set her suitors
each a task to perform; one should build the fortifications round the
summit, the other should sink a well to provide the castle with
water<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>; and she promised her hand to the suitor who should first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
complete his task. Now she supposed the sinking of the well to
be the lighter task and therefore assigned it to the suitor whom
she favoured; but he met with unforeseen difficulties, and his
rival meanwhile made steady progress with the walls. At last
they were wellnigh built, and it remained only to put in place the
keystone over the main gate. Then Aphrodite, marking the
danger, went with winning words and smiles and bade the builder
lay aside his tools, for the prize was now safely in his grasp, and
led him away to a grassy spot where she beguiled him so long
with tender words and caresses, that the other suitor meanwhile
redoubling his efforts pierced the rock and found water in plenty.</p>

<p>In this story the character, as well as the name, of the queen
is that of the ancient goddess; but there are other points too
deserving of notice. Perrot points out that in the neighbourhood
of the modern monastery at Daphni there stood in antiquity a
temple of Aphrodite<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>; and to this fact Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, in commenting
on the story, adds that on the summit of Acro-Corinth also there
was a sanctuary of the goddess<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, while he accounts for the mention
of that place in an Attic story by the fact that Corinth was
specially famous for the worship of Aphrodite.</p>

<p>No other vestiges of the actual name, so far as I know, are to
be found, save that among certain Maniote settlers in Corsica the
corrupt derivative, <span class="greek">Ἀφροδήτησσα</span><a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> (which would perhaps be better
spelt <span class="greek">Ἀφροδίτισσα</span>) was until recent times at any rate applied to
an equally corrupt class of women, votaries of <span class="greek">Ἀφροδίτη Πάνδημος</span>.
In a few stories however from Zacynthos<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> the same goddess is
prettily described as <span class="greek">ἡ μάνα τοῦ Ἔρωτα</span><a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>, ‘the Mother of Love,’
a title competent in itself to establish her identity.</p>

<p>The first of these stories tells how a poor maiden fell in love
with a youth of high degree, and went to the Mother of Love to
ask her help. The latter promised to ask the assistance of her
son Eros (<span class="greek">Ἔρωτας</span>) when he came home. Next morning went
Eros with bow and arrows and sat at the maiden’s door till the
swain passed by. Then suddenly he shot his arrow at him, and
the young man loved the maiden and took her to wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>Another yet more remarkable story introduces us to the garden
of Eros, whither a prince once went to fetch water to cure the
blindness of the king, his father. ‘There at the entrance he
beheld a woman that was the fairest upon earth; she sat at the
gate and played with a boy who had wings and in his hand held
a bow and many arrows. The garden was full of roses, and over
them hovered many little winged boys like butterflies. In the
midst of this garden was a spring, whence the healing water flowed.
As the king’s son drew near to this spring, he espied therein a
woman white as snow and shining as the moon; and it was in
very truth the moon that bathed there. Beside the spring sat a
second woman of exceeding beauty who was the Mother of Eros
(<span class="greek">ἡ μάνα τοῦ Ἔρωτα</span>).’ She gave him the water and her blessing,
and his father was healed.</p>

<p>The distinct reminiscence of Artemis in this story will be
noticed later<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>; here we need only notice a few points in the
story relating to Eros and his mother. The description of the
‘boy who had wings and in his hand held a bow and many
arrows’ is simply and purely classical, according exactly with the
Orphic address to him as <span class="greek">τοξάλκη, πτερόεντα</span><a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. The ‘woman at
the gate who was the fairest upon earth’ is in all probability the
same as ‘the Mother of Eros’ beside the spring, the single personality,
by some vagary in the transmission of the story, having
become duplicated. The roses, of which the garden was full, are
the flower always sacred to Aphrodite, the sweetest emblem of
love; and over these it is fitting that the ‘little winged boys’
should hover, brothers as it were of Eros, ever-fresh embodiments
of love, to all of whom, in antiquity, Aphrodite was mother<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>These folk-tales present sufficient evidence that the memory
of the name and attributes of Aphrodite survived locally until
recent times to warrant the conclusion that her worship, like
that of other pagan deities, possessed vitality enough to compete
for a long while with Christianity for the favour of the common-folk;
but as a personality she is no longer present, I think, to
their consciousness; she is at most only a character in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
folk-stories&mdash;if indeed the present generation has not forgotten
even these. For my part, I never heard mention of her in story
or otherwise, although her son, the winged Eros, is often named
in the love-songs which form a large part of the popular poetry.</p>

<p>Vows and offerings which would in former days have been made
to Aphrodite are now made either to suitable saints who have
taken her place, such as S. Catharine<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>, or to the Fates (<span class="greek">Μοίραις</span>),
who were from of old associated with her. According to a fragment
of Epimenides<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>, ‘golden Aphrodite and the deathless Fates’
were daughters of Cronos and Euonyme. Their sisterly relation
was recognised also in cult. Near the Ilissus once stood a
temple containing an old wooden statue (<span class="greek">ξόανον</span>) of Heavenly
Aphrodite with an inscription naming her ‘eldest of the Fates’
(<span class="greek">πρεσβυτέρα τῶν Μοιρῶν</span>)<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. So venerable a shrine must in old
time have witnessed many a petition for success in love; and
when we bear in mind the ancient inscription of the statue, it is
interesting to find that among the girls of Athens until recent
times the custom prevailed of visiting the so-called ‘hollow hill<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>’
(<span class="greek">τρύπιο βουνό</span>) in the immediate neighbourhood to offer to the
Fates cakes with honey and salt and to consult them as to their
destined husbands<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.</p>

<p>Sacred also to Aphrodite in old days was a cave in the
neighbourhood of Naupactus, frequented particularly by widows
anxious to be remarried<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>. At the present day a cave at the foot
of Mt Rigani, which may probably be identified as the old
sanctuary, is the spot to which girls repair in order to consult
the Fates on the all-absorbing question<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus it seems that ‘golden Aphrodite’ has disappeared from
the old sisterly group of deities, and that ‘the deathless Fates’
alone remain to receive prayers and to grant boons which once
fell within the province rather of Aphrodite. To the Fates we
must now turn.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">§ 8. <span class="smcap">The Fates.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The custom of taking or sending offerings to a cave haunted
by the Fates, of which we have just seen two examples, is widely
extended among the women of Greece. In Athens, besides the
‘hollow hill,’ two or three of the old rock-dwellings round about
the Hill of the Muses were formerly a common resort for the
same purpose, and the practice though rarer now is not yet
extinct<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. Among the best-known of these resorts is the so-called
Prison of Socrates. Dodwell, in his account of his travels in
Greece at the beginning of last century, states that he found
there ‘in the inner chamber, a small feast consisting of a cup
of honey and white almonds, a cake on a little napkin, and a vase
of aromatic herbs burning and exhaling an agreeable perfume<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>’;
and the observance of the custom is known to have continued
in that place down to recent years<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. The same practice, I was
informed at Sparta, is known at the present day to the peasant-women
of the surrounding plain, who will undertake even a long
and wearisome journey to lay a honey-cake in a certain cave on
one of the eastern spurs of Taÿgetus. Other places in which to
my own knowledge the custom still continues are Agrinion in
Aetolia and neighbouring districts, the villages of Mt Pelion in
Thessaly, and the island of Scyros; and from the testimony of
many other observers I conclude that it is, or was till recently,
universal in Greek lands.</p>

<p>Nor does there seem to be much variety in the subjects on
which the peasant-women consult the Fates: with the girls
matrimony, with the married women maternity, is the perpetually
recurring theme. Everywhere also honey in some form is an
essential part of the offering by which the Fates’ favour is to be
won. The acceptance of this offering, and therefore also the
success of the prayers which accompany it, are occasionally, as
in the cave near Sparta which I have mentioned, inferred from
omens provided by the dripping of water from the roof of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
cave; but more usually the realisation of the conjugal aspirations
is not assured, unless a second visit to the sanctuary, three days
or a month later, proves that the sweetmeats have been accepted
by the Fates and are gone. This, I am told, occurs with some
frequency. Dodwell mentions that his donkey ate some<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>; and
considering the character of the offerings&mdash;cakes and honey for
the most part, for only in the ‘hollow hill’ at Athens was salt
added thereto&mdash;it is not surprising if the Fates find many willing
proxies, human and canine as well as asinine.</p>

<p>At the moment when these delicacies are proffered, an invocation
is recited. This may take the form of a metrical line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="greek">Μοίραις μου, μοιράνετέ με, καὶ καλὸ φαγὶ σας φέρνω</span>,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Kind Fates, ordain my fate, for I bring you good fare,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>or may be a simple prose formulary,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="greek">Μοίραις τῶν Μοιρῶν καὶ τῆς τάδε ἡ Μοῖρα, κοπιάστε νὰ φᾶτε καὶ νὰ ξαναμοιράνετε
τὴν τάδε νἄχῃ καλὴ μοῖρα</span><a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>,</p>

<p>‘Fates above all Fates, and Fate of N., come ye, I pray, and eat, and
ordain anew the fate of N., that she may have a good fate.’</p>
</div>

<p>Various other versions are also on record, one of which will be
considered later; but these two examples illustrate sufficiently
for the present the simple Homeric tenour of such prayers.</p>

<p>The words which I have quoted, it must be admitted, give
clear expression to the hope that the Fates may revise the decrees
which they have already pronounced on the fortunes of the
suppliant. Nevertheless that such a hope should be fulfilled is
contrary to the general beliefs of the people. The Fates, they
know, are inexorable so far as concerns the changing of any of
their purposes once set; for, as their proverb runs, <span class="greek">ὅτι γράφουν ᾑ
Μοίραις, δὲν ξεγράφουν</span>, ‘what the Fates write, that they make
not unwritten<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.’ They are not, it would appear, subordinate, as
Charon is sometimes deemed to be, even to the supreme God;
I can find no song or story that would so present them. They
are absolute and irresponsible in the fashioning of human destiny.
But the Greek peasants are not the first who have at the same
time believed both in predestination and in the efficacy of prayer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Perhaps all unconsciously they reconcile the ideas as did Aeschylus
of old:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">τὸ μόρσιμον μένει πάλαι,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">εὐχομένοις δ’ ἂν ἔλθοι<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Destiny hath long been abiding its time, but in answer to prayer may
come.’</p>
</div>

<p>But even without any intuition of so hard a doctrine the
peasant-women may justify their prayers and offerings by the
hope that, though the Fates will detract nothing from the fulfilment
of whatsoever they have spoken or written, they may be
willing to add thereto such supplement as shall modify in large
measure the issue. For the Fates are as Greek in character as
their worshippers, and stories are not wanting to illustrate the
shifts to which they have stooped in order practically to invalidate
without formally cancelling their whilom purpose.</p>

<p>‘Once upon a time a poor woman gave birth to a daughter,
and on the third night after the birth the Fates came to ordain
the child’s lot. As they entered the cottage they saw prepared
for them a table with a clean cloth and all manner of sweetmeats
thereon. So when they had partaken thereof and were content,
they were kindly disposed toward the child. And the first Fate
gave to her long life, and the second beauty, and the third
chastity. But as they went forth from the cottage, the first of
them tripped against the threshold, and turning in wrath towards
the infant pronounced that she should be always an idler.</p>

<p>Now when she was grown up, she was so beautiful that the
king’s son would have her to wife. As the wedding-day drew
near, her mother and her friends chided her because she delayed
to make her wedding dress; but she was idle and heeded not.
Soon came the eve of the wedding, and she wept because the
prince would learn of her idleness and refuse to take her to wife.
Now the Fates loved her, and saw her tears and pitied her. Therefore
they came suddenly before her, and asked why she wept;
and she told them all. Then sat they down there and spun and
weaved and embroidered all that night, and in the morning they
arrayed her in a bridal dress decked with gold and pearls such
as had never been seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>Presently came the prince, and there was much feasting and
dancing, and she was far the most beautiful of all the company.
And because he saw her lovely dress and knew how much toil it
must have cost her to array herself thus for him, he granted her
the favour of doing no more work all her days<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.’</p>

<p>This story, besides illustrating well the finality of every word
pronounced by the Fates and the means which they may employ
to mitigate their own severity, is typical too of the ideas generally
accepted concerning the Fates. Their number is three<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>,
and they are seen in the shape of old women, one of whom
at least is always engaged in spinning. Of the remaining two,
one is sometimes seen bearing a book wherein to record in writing
the decrees which the three jointly utter, while the other carries
a pair of scissors wherewith to cut the thread of life at the appointed
time; or again sometimes these two also are spinning,
one of them carrying a basket of wool or a distaff and the other
fashioning the thread. This association of the Fates with spinning
operations is commemorated in certain popular phrases by the
comparison of man’s life to a thread. ‘His thread is cut’ or ‘is
finished’ (<span class="greek">κόπηκε</span> or <span class="greek">σώθηκε ἡ κλωστή του</span>) is a familiar euphemism
for ‘he is dead’: and again, with the same ultimate meaning but
a somewhat different metaphor, the people of Arachova use the
phrase <span class="greek">μαζώθηκε τὸ κουβάρ’ του</span><a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>, ‘his spindle is wound full,’&mdash;an
expression which seems to imply the idea that the Fates apportion
to each man at birth a mass of rough wool from which they go
on spinning day by day till the thread of life is completed.</p>

<p>According to Fauriel<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>, a reminiscence of the Fates is also to
be found in a personification of the plague (<span class="greek">ἡ πανοῦκλα</span>), which
in the tradition of some districts is not represented as a single
demon but has been multiplied into a trio of terrible women who
pass through the towns and devastate them, one of them carrying
a roll on which to write the names of the victims, another a pair of
scissors wherewith to cut them off from the living, and the third a
broom with which to sweep them away. He assigns however no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
reason for identifying the deadly trio with the Fates, and it is
more natural, if any link with antiquity here exists, to connect
them with the Erinyes<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> or other similar deities. In fact their resemblance
to the Fates, save for some superficial details, is small.
The Fates, though inexorable when once their decree is pronounced,
are never wantonly cruel. Their displeasure may indeed be aroused
by neglect, as we shall shortly see, to such an extent that they will
visit the sins of the fathers upon the children. But, when men
treat them with the consideration and the reverence due to deities,
they are unfailingly kindly, and deserve the title by which they
are sometimes known, <span class="greek">ᾑ καλοκυράδες</span>, ‘the good ladies.’ For this
name is not an euphemism concealing dread and hatred, but an
expression of genuine reverence; such at any rate is my judgement,
based on many conversations with the common-folk in all
parts of Greece&mdash;for on this topic for some reason there is far less
reticence than on many others. And indeed if the character of
the Fates were believed to be cruel, their aspect also would be
represented as grim and menacing; whereas they are actually
pourtrayed as deserving almost of pity rather than awe by reason
of their age and their infirmity.</p>

<p>The occasion on which the Fates have most often been seen
by human eyes and on which, even though invisible, they never
fail to be present, is the third night (or as some say the fifth
night<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>) after the birth of a child. Provision for their arrival is
then scrupulously made. The dog is chained up. Any obstacles
over which the visitors might trip in the darkness are removed.
The house-door is left open or at any rate unlatched. Inside
a light is kept burning, and in the middle of the room is set
a low table with three cushions or low stools placed round it&mdash;religious
conservatism apparently forbidding the use of so modern
an invention as chairs, for at the lying-in-state before a funeral
also cushions or low stools are provided for the mourners. On
the table are set out such dainties as the Fates love, including
always honey; in Athens formerly the essentials were a dish of
honey, three white almonds, a loaf of bread, and a glass of water<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and ready to hand, as presents from which the goddesses may
choose what they will, may be laid all the most costly treasures of
the family, such as jewellery and even money, in token that
nothing has been spared to give them welcome. These preparations
made, their visit is awaited in solemn silence; for none must
speak when the Fates draw near. Most often they are neither
seen nor heard; but sometimes, it is said, a wakeful mother has
seen their forms as they bent over her child and wrote their
decrees on its brow&mdash;for which reason moles and other marks on
the forehead or the nose are in some places called <span class="greek">γραψίματα
τῶν Μοιρῶν</span><a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>, ‘writings of the Fates’; sometimes she has heard
the low sound of their voices as they consulted together over the
future of the child; nay more, she has even caught and understood
their speech; yet even so her foreknowledge of the infant’s fate
is unavailing; she may be aware of the dangers which await its
ripening years, but though forewarned she is powerless to forearm;
against destiny once pronounced all weapons, all wiles, are futile.</p>

<p>Neglect of any of the due preparations for the visit of the
Fates may excite their wrath and cause them to decree an evil
lot for the child. This idea is the <i>motif</i> of many fables current
in Greece. A typical example is furnished by the following
extract from a popular poem in which a man whose life has
brought him nothing but misery sees in a vision one of the Fates
and appeals to her thus:</p>

</div>

<p>The Fates, it has been already said, are three in number;
why so, it seems impossible to determine. It may be that the
functions discharged by them fell readily into a three-fold division;
thus in the district of Zagorion in Epirus, one Fate ‘spins
the thread’ (<span class="greek">κλώθει τὸ γνέμα</span>) which determines the length of
life, the second apportions good fortune, and the third bad<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>. Or
again, the division may have been made in such a way that
one Fate should preside over each of the three great events of
human experience, birth, marriage, and death. The term ‘fate’
(<span class="greek">μοῖρα</span>)<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> is often used by women as a synonym for marriage
(<span class="greek">γάμος</span>)&mdash;in curious contrast with the man’s more optimistic
description of his wedding as <span class="greek">χαρά</span>, ‘joy’; and a Greek proverb,
used of a very ignorant man, <span class="greek">δὲν ξέρει τὰ τρία κακὰ τῆς Μοίρας
του</span>, ‘he does not know the three evils of his Fate,’ to wit
birth, marriage, and death, carries the connexion of fate with
these three events a little further. But such distributions of
functions are probably posterior to the choice of the number.
Three was always a sacred number, and the ancients delighted
in trinities of goddesses<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>.</p>

<p>But besides the three great Fates we must recognise also in
modern Greece the existence of lesser Fates, attached each to
a single human life. This is a slight extension of the main
belief, and consists really in the personification of the objective
fate which the three great Fates decree. Just as each man is
believed to have his good guardian-angel and, by antithesis
but with less biblical warranty, his bad angel, so too he is
accompanied by his own personal Fate. But these lesser Fates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
are only faint replicas of the great trinity, and I doubt whether
they are believed to have any independent power of their own;
they would seem to be mere ministers who carry out the original
decrees of the three supreme Fates.</p>

<p>Often in the popular songs it is impossible to tell whether
it is the lesser personal Fate or one of the great trio who is
addressed. For in such lines as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">Παρακαλῶ σε, Μοῖρα μου, νὰ μή με ξενιτέψῃς,</div>

<p>‘I pray thee, good Fate, send me not to a strange land, but if it be my

</div>

<p>the form of address <span class="greek">Μοῖρα μου</span> (literally ‘my Fate’) implies no
personal possession, but is the same as that employed in praying
to God or the Virgin, <span class="greek">Θεέ μου, Παναγία μου</span>. But in definite forms
of incantation, composed for recitation along with propitiatory
offerings, the great Fates and the lesser Fate of the individual
suppliant are coupled in a way which shows the difference in
importance between them. The former are called ‘the Fates
over all Fates’ (<span class="greek">ἡ Μοίραις τῶν Μοιρῶν</span>), as in the plain prose
formulary quoted above; the latter is merely the Fate of this
or that person.</p>

<p>Whether these inferior Fates were known also in the classical
period is a question which I am unable to answer; but that the
belief in them is certainly of no recent growth is proved by an
incantation more elaborate than those given above and on
internal evidence very <span class="lock">old:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>‘From Olympus, even from the summit, from the three heights of heaven,
where dwell the Fates of all Fates and my own Fate, may she hearken and

</div>

<p>The version of the formula which I have given is only one out
of several which have been recorded from various parts of Greece<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and there can be no doubt that the original was a widely-esteemed
incantation. I have given the most intelligible; but the mere
fact that some of the others, through verbal corruption in the
course of tradition, have become almost meaningless, is strong
proof of the antiquity of the original. There are however two
clear marks of antiquity in the version before us. The mention
of Olympus as the abode of deities carries us back at once to the
classical age; and the word <span class="greek">κόλυμβος</span> in the sense of ‘summit’
is no less suggestive of a very early date. The ancient word
<span class="greek">κόρυμβος</span>, used in this sense by Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and by Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>,
is obsolete now in the spoken language. But <span class="greek">κόλυμβος</span> is
evidently either a dialectic form of it (with the common interchange
of <span class="greek">λ</span> and <span class="greek">ρ</span>) or else a corrupt form, not understood by
those who continued to use it in this incantation, and assimilated,
by way of assonance, to <span class="greek">Ὄλυμπος</span>. Further one of the other
versions gives the word as <span class="greek">κόρυβο</span><a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>, where the original <span class="greek">ρ</span> is
retained but the <span class="greek">μ</span> lost before <span class="greek">β</span>, which now universally has
the sound of the English <i>v</i>. A comparison of the two forms
therefore establishes beyond question the fact that the somewhat
rare classical word <span class="greek">κόρυμβος</span>, in its known meaning of ‘summit,’
was the original form. Hence the incantation, containing both
a mention of Olympus as the seat of deities and an old classical
word long since disused, cannot but date from very early times.
Possibly therefore the belief in subordinate Fates, attached each
to one human being, was known to the common-folk of the
classical age.</p>

<p>But, be this as it may, the popular conception of the great
Trinity of Fates has persisted unchanged for more than a score
of centuries&mdash;and who shall say for how many more? Here the
literary tradition of classical times was evidently faithful to popular
traditions. The number of the Fates is still the same as in
Hesiod’s day<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>; they are still depicted as old and infirm women,
as they were by the poets at any rate in antiquity, though in
ancient art, for beauty’s sake, they are apt to be figured as more
youthful; it is still their task ‘to assign to mortal men at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
birth,’ as Hesiod knew, ‘both good and ill<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>’; the functions of
Clotho who spun the thread of life, of Lachesis who apportioned
destiny, and of Atropos whom none might turn from her purpose,
are still the joint functions of the great Three; the book, the
spindle, and an instrument for cutting the thread of life are still
their attributes.</p>

<p>There is little new therefore to be learnt from the study of
the Fates in modern folk-lore. The lesson which it teaches rather
is the continuity of the present with the past. But there is one
point to which special attention may perhaps be directed&mdash;the
belief that the Fates invariably visit each child that is born in
order to decree its lot. I do not wish to engage in the controversy
which has raged round the identification of the figures
in the east pediment of the Parthenon; but those who would
recognise among them the three Fates may fairly draw a fresh
argument from the strength of this popular belief. It is only
fitting that at the birth of Athena from the head of Zeus the
Fates should be present; for even Zeus himself, said Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>,
might not escape their decree.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 9. <span class="smcap">The Nymphs.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Of all the supernatural beings who haunt the path and the
imagination of the modern Greek peasant by far the most common
are the Nymphs or ‘Nereids’ (<span class="greek">Νεράϊδες</span>). The name itself occurs
in a multitude of dialectic varieties<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>, but its meaning is everywhere
uniform, and more comprehensive than that of the ancient word.
It is no longer confined to nymphs of the sea, but embraces also
their kindred of mountain, river, and woodland. There is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
longer a Nereus, god of the sea, to claim the Nereids as his daughters,
denizens like himself of the deep; and the connexion of their
name with the modern word for ‘water’ (<span class="greek">νερό</span>) is not understanded
of the common-folk. Hence there has been nothing to restrain the
extension of the term <span class="greek">Νεράϊδα</span>, and it has entirely superseded, in
this sense, the ancient <span class="greek">νύμφη</span>, which in modern speech can only
mean ‘a bride.’</p>

<p>The familiarity of the peasants with the Nereids is more
intimate than can be easily imagined by those who have merely
travelled, it may be, through the country but have no knowledge of
the people in their homes. The educated classes of course, and
with them some of the less communicative of the peasants, will
deny all belief in such beings and affect to deride as old wives’
fables the many stories concerning them. But in truth the
belief is one which even men of considerable culture fail sometimes
to eradicate from their own breasts. A paper on the Nereids (the
nucleus of the present chapter) was read by me in Athens at an
open meeting of the British School; and no sooner was it ended
than an Athenian gentleman whose name is well known in certain
learned circles throughout Europe rose hurriedly crossing himself
and disappeared without a word of leave-taking. As for the
peasants, let them deny or avow their belief, there is probably
no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least
do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and the
malice of the Nereids, while many a man may still be found ready
to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty and passion
and caprice. Nor is it a matter of faith only; more than once I
have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight
to several persons (so at least they averred); and there was a
wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of
their appearance and dress. I myself once had a Nereid pointed
out to me by my guide, and there certainly was the semblance of
a female figure draped in white and tall beyond human stature
flitting in the dusk between the gnarled and twisted boles of an
old olive-yard. What the apparition was, I had no leisure to
investigate; for my guide with many signs of the cross and
muttered invocations of the Virgin urged my mule to perilous haste
along the rough mountain-path. But had I inherited, as he, a
belief in Nereids together with a fertile gift of mendacity, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
doubtless have corroborated the highly-coloured story which he
told when we reached the light and safety of the next village; and
the ready acceptance of the story by those who heard it proved to
me that a personal encounter with Nereids was really reckoned
among the possible incidents of every-day life.</p>

<p>The awe in which the Nereids are held is partially responsible,
without doubt, for the many adulatory by-names by which they are
known. Now and again indeed a peasant, when he is suffering
from some imagined injury at their hands, may so far speak his
mind concerning them as to call them ‘evil women’ (<span class="greek">κακαὶς</span> or
<span class="greek">ἄσχημαις γυναῖκες</span>): but in general his references are more
diplomatic and conciliatory in tone. He adopts the same attitude
towards them as did his forefathers towards the Furies; and, though
the actual word ‘Eumenides’ is lost to his vocabulary, the spirit of
his address is unchanged. ‘The Ladies’ (<span class="greek">ᾑ κυρᾶδες</span>), ‘Our Maidens’
(<span class="greek">τὰ κουρίτσι̯α μας</span>), ‘Our good Queens’ (<span class="greek">ᾑ καλαὶς ἀρχόντισσαις</span>),
‘The kind-hearted ones’ (<span class="greek">ᾑ καλόκαρδαις</span>), ‘The ladies to whom we
wish joy’ (<span class="greek">ᾑ χαιράμεναις</span>), or most commonly of all ‘Our good
Ladies’ (<span class="greek">ᾑ καλοκυρᾶδες</span> or <span class="greek">καλλικυρᾶδες</span>)<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>,&mdash;such is the wonted
style of his adulation, in which the frequent use of the word
<span class="greek">κυρᾶδες</span> (the plural of <span class="greek">κυρά</span>, i.e. <span class="greek">κυρία</span>) is a heritage from his
ancestors who made dedications ‘to the lady nymphs’ (<span class="greek">κυρίαις
νύμφαις</span>). Yet it may be questioned whether these by-names are
wholly euphemistic; for mingled with the awe which the Nereids
inspire there is certainly an element of admiration and, I had
almost said, of affection in the feelings of the common-folk
toward them.</p>

<p>The Nereids are conceived as women half-divine yet not immortal,
always young, always beautiful, capricious at best, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
their worst cruel. Their presence is suspected everywhere; grim
forest-depth and laughing valley, babbling stream and wind-swept
ridge, tree and cave and pool, each may be their chosen haunt, the
charmed scene of their dance and song and godlike revelry. The
old distinctions between the nymphs according to their habitations
still to some extent hold good; there are nymphs of the sea and
nymphs of the streams, tree-nymphs and mountain-nymphs; but
in characteristics these several classes are alike, in grace, in frolic,
in wantonness. Of all that is light and mirthful they are the
ideal; of all that is lovely the exquisite embodiment; and their
hearts beneath are ever swayed by fierce gusts of love and
of hate.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Nereids, the sweetness of their voices, and
the grace and litheness of their movements have given rise to many
familiar phrases which are eloquent of feelings other than awe in
the people’s minds. ‘She is fair as a Nereid’ (<span class="greek">εἶνε ὤμορφη σὰ
νεράϊδα</span>), ‘she has the eyes, the arms, the bosom of a Nereid’
(<span class="greek">ἔχει μάτια, χέρια, βυζιὰ νεράϊδας</span>), ‘she sings, she dances, like
a Nereid’ (<span class="greek">τραγουδάει, χορεύει, σὰ νεράϊδα</span>),&mdash;such are the compliments
time and again passed upon a bride, whose white dress
and ornaments of gold seem to complete the resemblance. Possibly
the twofold usage in antiquity of the word <span class="greek">νύμφη</span> is responsible for
a still surviving association of bridal dress with the Nereids; it is
at any rate to the peasants’ mind an incontestable fact that white
and gold are the colours chiefly affected by Nereids in their dress<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p>

<p>Only in one particular is the beauty of the Nereids ever
thought to be marred; in some localities they are said to have the
feet of goats or of asses<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>; as for instance the three Nereids who
are believed to dance together without pause on the heights
of Taÿgetus. But this is a somewhat rare and local trait, and
must have been transferred to them, it would seem, from Pan
and his attendant satyrs, with whom of old they were wont to
consort; in general they are held to be of beauty unblemished.</p>

<p>Their accomplishments include, besides singing and dancing,
the humbler arts of the good housewife. ‘She cooks like a Nereid’
(<span class="greek">μαγειρεύει σὰ νεράϊδα</span>) and ‘she does house-cleaning like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Nereid’ (<span class="greek">παστρεύει σὰν ἀνεράϊδα</span>) are phrases of commendation<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
occasionally heard. But chiefly do they excel in the art of
spinning<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>; and so well known is their dexterity therein that
a delicate kind of creeper with which trees are often festooned
is known in the vulgar tongue under the pretty name of <span class="greek">νεραϊδογνέματα</span>,
‘Nereid-spinnings.’ The attribute indeed is natural and
obvious; for the popular conception of the nymphs is but an
idealisation of the peasant-women, to whom, whether sitting in
the sunlight at their cottage-door or tending their sheep and
goats afield, the distaff is an ever constant companion. But, easy
though it is to account for the trait, some interest, if no great
measure of importance, attaches to its consonance with the ancient
characterisation of Nymphs. To the Nereids proper<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> a golden
spindle was specially assigned; and in the cave of the Naiads
in Ithaca might be seen, in Odysseus’ day, the kindred occupation
of weaving, for ‘therein were great looms of stone whereon the
nymphs wove sea-purple robes, a wonder to behold<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.’</p>

<p>As might be expected of beings so divinely feminine, their
relations with men and with women are very different; in the
one case there is the possibility of love; in the other the certainty
of spite. It is necessary therefore to examine their attitude
towards either sex separately.</p>

<p>The marriage of men with Nereids not only forms the theme
of many folk-stories current in Greece, but in the more remote
districts is still regarded as a credible occurrence. Even at the
present day the traveller may hear of families in whose ancestry
of more or less remote date is numbered a Nereid. A Thessalian
peasant whom I once met claimed a Nereid-grandmother, and
little as his looks warranted the assumption of any grace or beauty
in so near an ancestor&mdash;he happened to have a squint&mdash;his claim
appeared to be admitted by his fellow-villagers, and a certain
prestige attached to him. Hence the epithet ‘Nereid-born’
(<span class="greek">νεραϊδογεννημένος</span> or <span class="greek">νεραϊδοκαμωμένος</span>) frequently heard in amatory
distichs<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> may formerly have been not merely an exaggerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
compliment to the lady’s beauty, but a recognition of high birth
calculated to conciliate the future mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Nor is it men only whose susceptibilities are stirred by the
beauty of the Nereids; even animals may fall under their spell.
A shepherd of Scopelos told me that in the neighbouring island of
Ioura, which he frequented with his flocks for pasturage, he once
tamed a wild goat, which after a time began to behave very oddly.
All night long it would remain with the rest of his flock, but in the
daytime it persistently strayed away from the pasture to the neighbourhood
of a Nereid-haunted cave on the bare and rocky hillside,
and from want of food became very thin. The goat, he believed,
was enamoured of a Nereid and pining away from unrequited love.</p>

<p>But it is from the old folk-stories rather than from the records
of contemporary or recent experience that the character of the
Nereids as lovers or wives is best learnt. And herein they are not
models of womanhood; passion indeed they feel and inspire; they
suffer, they even seek the caresses of the young and brave; but
true wives they will not long remain. Constancy and care are not
for them; the longing for freedom and the breezes of heaven, the
memory of rapid tuneful dance, are hot within them; they leave
the men whose strength and valour snared their hearts, they forsake
their homes and children, and on the wings of the wind are gone,
seeking again their etherial unwearied fellows. Yet they do not
altogether forget their children; for motherhood is presently more
to them than mirth; ever and anon they steal back to visit their
homes and bless their children with the gifts of beauty and wealth
which their touch can bestow, and even stay to mend their husbands’
clothes and clean the house, vanishing again however before the
man’s return. Only in one case have I heard of a nymph’s continued
intimacy with a man throughout his life, and that strangely enough
not in a folk-story but in recent experience. Their relations, it
must be acknowledged, were illicit, for he had a human wife and
family; but it was commonly reported that his rise from penury to
affluence and the mayoralty of his native village was the work of a
Nereid in a cave near by, who of her love for him enriched the
produce of his land and shielded his flocks from pestilence.</p>

<p>In the popular stories which deal with the marriages of
Nereids, the bridal fashion of their dress, which has already been
noticed, is often an essential feature of the plot. In one tale it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
said explicitly that the supernatural quality of the Nereids lies not
in their persons but in their raiment<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>; and for this reason a prince,
smitten with love of the youngest of three sister Nereids but
knowing not how to win her, is counselled by a wise woman,
to whom he confides his perplexity, to lie in wait when they go to
bathe in their accustomed pool and to steal the clothes of his
<i>inamorata</i>, who would then follow him to recover her loss and so
be in his power to take to wife. But there is greater delicacy
and, as we shall see, more certain antiquity also in the commoner
version of the episode, in which a kerchief alone is possessed of
the magic powers ascribed above to the whole dress. And in this
detail of costume the resemblance of bride and Nereid still holds
good; for no wedding-dress would be complete without a kerchief
either wrapped about the bride’s head or pinned upon her breast
or carried in her hand to form a link with her neighbour in the
chain of dancers<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the stories which have for their <i>motif</i> the theft of such
a kerchief from a Nereid<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> the following Messenian tale is a
good example.</p>

<p>‘Once upon a time there was a young shepherd who played the
pipes so beautifully that the Nereids one night carried him off to
the threshing-floor where they danced and bade him play to them.
At first he was much afraid and thought that some evil would
overtake him from being in their company and speaking with them.
But gradually, as he grew accustomed to his strange surroundings
and the Nereids showed themselves kind to him and grateful for
his piping, he took courage again and night after night made his
way to the spot which they haunted and made music till cock-crow.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that one of the Nereids was beautiful
beyond the rest, and the shepherd loved her and determined to
make her his wife. But inasmuch as the Nereids danced all night
long without pause while he piped, and at dawn vanished to be
seen no more until the next night’s dance began, he knew not
what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p>So at last he went to an old woman and told her his trouble,
and she said to him, “Go again to-night and play till dawn is
near; then before the cock crows<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>, make a dash and seize the
kerchief in the Nereid’s hand, and hold it fast. And though she
change into terrible shapes, be not afraid; only hold fast until
she take again her proper form; then must she do as thou
wilt.”</p>

<p>The young man therefore went again that night and played
till close on dawn. Then as the Nereid passed close beside him,
leading the dance, he sprang upon her and grasped the kerchief.
And straightway the cock crew, and the other Nereids fled; but
she whose kerchief he had seized could not go, but at once began
to transform herself into horrible shapes in hope to frighten the
shepherd and make him loose his hold. First she became a lion,
but he remembered the witch’s warning and held fast for all the
lion’s roaring. And then the Nereid turned into a snake, and
then into fire<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>, but he kept a stout heart and would not let go the
kerchief. Then at last she returned to her proper form and went
home with him and was his wife and bore him a son; but the
kerchief he kept hidden from her, lest she should become a Nereid
again.’</p>

<p>In this story there are two ancient traits especially noteworthy.
The power of transformation into horrible shapes is precisely the
means of defence which the Nereid Thetis once sought to employ
against Peleus; the forms of wild beast and of fire, which she
assumed according to ancient myth, are the same as Nereids now
adopt; and the instructions now given to hold fast until the Nereid
resume her proper shape are the same as Chiron, the wise Centaur,
gave once to Peleus<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. It is true that in the ancient story it is the
person of Thetis that Peleus was bidden to grasp, while in the
modern tale the shepherd’s immediate object is to retain hold
of the kerchief only. But this feature of the story too is an
interesting witness to antiquity, although in Thetis’ history it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
does not appear. Ancient art has left to us several representations<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> of
nymphs with veil-like scarves worn on the head or borne in the hand
and floating down the breeze; and the magic properties inherent
in them are exemplified by Ino’s gift, or rather loan, to Odysseus.
The scarf imperishable (<span class="greek">κρήδεμνον ἄμβροτον</span>) which she bade him
gird about his breast and have no fear of any suffering nor of
death, was not his own to keep after he reached the mainland; in
accordance with her behest ‘he loosed then the goddess’ scarf from
about him, and let it fall into the river’s salt tide, and a great wave
bore it back down the stream, and readily did Ino catch it in her
hands’<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>. Here Ino’s anxiety and strait command as to the return
of her veil are most easily understood by the aid of the modern
belief which makes the possession of the scarf or kerchief the sole,
or at least the chief, means of godlike power. In Cythnos at the
present day it is the <span class="greek">μπόλια</span>, or scarf worn about the head, which
alone is believed to invest Nereids with their distinctive qualities<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>;
and if the modern scarf is a lineal descendant of the Homeric type
such as Ino wore&mdash;for even in feminine dress fashions are slow
to change in the Greek islands<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>&mdash;the epithet ‘imperishable’ may
have unsuspected force, as implying that the scarf confers a semblance
of divinity on its owner and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>In such of the stories of the above type as do not end with
the marriage of the Nereid<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> the sequel is not encouraging to other
adventurers. For though she be a good wife in commonplace
estimation&mdash;and the Greek view of matrimony is in general
commonplace to the verge of sordidness&mdash;though her skill in
domestic duties be as proverbial as her beauty, she either turns
her charms and her cunning to such account as to discover the
hiding-place of her stolen kerchief, or, failing this, so mopes and
pines over her work that her husband worn down by her sullenness
and persistent silence decides to risk all if he can but restore her
lightheartedness. Then though he have taken an oath of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
that she will not avail herself of her recovered freedom, but will
abide with him as his wife, her promise is light as the breeze that
bears her away with fluttering kerchief, and he is alone.</p>

<p>But fickleness is not the worst of the Nereids’ qualities in
their dealings with men. In malice they are as wanton as in love.
Woe betide him who trespasses upon their midday carnival or
crosses their nightly path; dumbness, blindness, epilepsy, and
horrors of mutilation have been the penalties of such intrusion,
though the man offend unwittingly; for the Nereids are tiger-like
in all, in stealth and cruelty as in grace and beauty; and none who
look upon their radiance can guess the darkness of their hearts.
Terrible was the experience of a Melian peasant, who coming
unawares upon the Nereids one night was bidden by them to
a cave hard by, where they feasted him and made merry together
and did not deny him their utmost favours; but when morning
broke, they sent him to his home shattered and impotent.</p>

<p>If such be sometimes the results of their seeming goodwill
and proffered companionship, how much more fearful a thing must
be their enmity! Let a man but intrude upon their revels in
some sequestered glen, or sleep beneath the tree that shelters
them, or play the pipe beside the river where they bathe, and
in such wrath they will gather about him<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>, that the eyes which
have looked upon them see no more, and the voice that cries
out is thenceforth dumb, and madness springs of their very
presence.</p>

<p>But if the Nereids are fickle and treacherous in their dealings
with men, towards women they are consistently malicious. Especially
on two occasions must every prudent peasant-woman be on
her guard against their envy&mdash;at marriage and in child-birth.
For though the Nereids themselves prove no true wives, so jealous
are they of the joys of wedlock, that if a bride be not well secured
from their molestation, they will mar the fruition of her love, or
else, where they cannot prevent, they will endeavour at the least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to cut short the happiness of motherhood, slaying with fever the
woman whose bliss has stirred their malevolence, yet sparing
always the child and even blessing it with beauty and wealth.</p>

<p>The means by which women most commonly protect themselves
on these occasions are the wearing of amulets; the fastening
of a bunch of garlic over the house-door; the painting of a cross
in black upon the lintel (this custom may be a Christianised
form of the ancient practice, mentioned by Photius<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>, of smearing
houses with pitch at the birth of children as a means of driving
away powers of evil); and, if any strange visitants are heard about
the house at night, the maintenance of strict silence. But steps
are also sometimes taken to appease the Nereids; offerings of
food, in which honey is the essential ingredient, are set out for
them, and formerly in Athens<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> to this a bride used to add two
chemises out of her trousseau.</p>

<p>Such precautions after a confinement are regularly continued
for forty days. It would appear that in ancient times this was
the period during which women were held to be specially exposed
to the evil eye and all other ghostly and sinister influences<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>,
including probably, as now, the assaults of nymphs; and in modern
usage the duration of the time of peril is so well established that
the word <span class="greek">σαραντίζω</span>, literally to ‘accomplish forty (<span class="greek">σαράντα</span>) days,’
is used technically of the churching of women at the end of that
period; while a more frankly pagan survival is to be found in the
fact that for forty days no right-minded mother will cross the
threshold of her own house to go out, nor enter a neighbour’s
house, without stepping on the door-key, that being the most
easily available piece of iron, a metal, which in the folk-lore of
ancient Greece<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>, as in that of many other countries, was a charm
and safeguard against the supernatural.</p>

<p>It is not however the mothers only, who need protection from
the Nereids, but the children also, and that too throughout their
childhood; yet not against the same perils; for the mother is
liable to malicious injuries; the child is safe indeed from wilful
hurt, but it may be stolen by Nereids. We have already seen how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Nereids who have wed with mortal men, though faithless to
their husbands, are yet drawn home now and again by love of
their children. And such of them too as have never yielded to
human embrace are yet instinct with a strange yearning to
possess a mortal woman’s prettiest little ones; on one child they
exert a fascination which unhappily proves fatal to it; another
they seize with open violence; or again they set stealthily in
some cradle a babe of pure Nereid birth&mdash;a changeling that by
some weird fatality is weakly and doomed to die&mdash;and carry off
to the woods and hills the human infant, in whom they delight,
to be their playmate and their fosterling. In a history of the
island of Pholegandros, the writer, a native of the place, accounts
for the multitude of small chapels in the island on the ground
of the peasants’ anxiety each to have a saint close to his property
to defend him from such raids by Nereids and other kindred
beings<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>.</p>

<p>The wife of a priest at Chalandri in Attica related to Ross<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
a story in point. ‘I had a daughter,’ she said, ‘a little girl
between twelve and thirteen years old, who showed a very strange
disposition. Though we all treated her kindly, her mood was
always melancholy, and whenever she got the chance she ran off
from the village up the wooded spurs of the mountain (Brilessos).
There she would roam about alone all day long, from early morning
till late evening; often she would take off some of her clothes
and wear but one light garment, so as to be less hindered in
running and jumping. We dared not stop her, for we saw quite
well that the Nereids had allured her, but we were much distressed.
It was in vain that my husband took her time after time
to the church and read prayers over her. The Panagia (the
Virgin) was powerless to help. After the child had been thus
afflicted a considerable while, she fell into yet deeper despondency,
and at last died&mdash;a short time ago. When we buried her, the
neighbours said, “Do not wonder at her death; the Nereids wanted
her; it is but two days since we saw her dancing with them.”’</p>

<p>Such was the view taken by a Greek priest and his wife concerning
the cause of their daughter’s death about two generations
ago; and at the present day the traveller may hear of similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
events in recent experience. An important point to notice is
that the child’s death was thought to be due, not to any malevolence
on the part of the Nereids, but to their desire to have her for
their own, a desire more happily gratified in cases of which I have
several times heard where the child has not died but has simply
disappeared. Thus in Arcadia I was once assured that a small girl
had been carried off by Nereids in a whirlwind, and had been found
again some weeks after on a lonely mountain side some five or six
hours distant from her home in a condition which showed that
she had been well fed and well cared for in the interval.</p>

<p>But certainly the snatching away of children by the Nereids,
whether this mean death or only disappearance, is still a well-accredited
fact in the minds of many of the common-folk. They
still remain too simple and too closely wedded to the beliefs of
their forefathers to need the old exhortation<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Trust ye the fables of yore: ’tis not Death, but the Nymphs of the river</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Seeing your daughter so sweet stole her to be their delight.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They believe still that the Nereids have befriended their children,
even while they weep for their own loss.</p>

<p>Whatever mischief the Nereids work upon man, woman, or
child, be it death or loss of faculties or merely deportation from
home to some haunted spot, ‘seized’ (<span class="greek">παρμένος</span> or <span class="greek">πιασμένος</span>)
is the word applied to the victim. The compound <span class="greek">ἀναρᾳδοπαρμένος</span><a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>,
‘Nereid-seized,’ also occurs, exactly parallel in form as well as
equivalent in meaning to the ancient <span class="greek">νυμφόληπτος</span> as used by Plato.
‘Now listen to me,’ says Socrates to Phaedrus<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>, ‘in silence; for in
very truth this seems to be holy ground, so that if anon, in the
course of what I say, I suffer a “seizure” (<span class="greek">νυμφόληπτος γένωμαι</span>),
you must not be surprised.’ Such speech, save for its disregard
of the acknowledged peril, might be held in all seriousness by
a peasant of to-day. In Socrates’ mouth it is intended merely as
a happy metaphor; but its point and appropriateness are lost on
those who do not both know the superstition to which he alludes
and at the same time recall the <i>mise-en-scène</i><a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> of the dialogue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
The two friends have crossed the Ilissus and are stretched on a
grassy slope in the shade of a lofty plane-tree, beneath which is
a spring of cool water pleasant to their feet as is the light breeze
to their faces in the heat of the summer noon. The spot must
surely be a favourite haunt of the rural gods, and indeed the
statues close at hand attest its dedication to Pan and to the
Nymphs. In such a situation there would be, according to modern
notions, three distinct grounds for apprehending a ‘seizure.’ The
neighbourhood of water is throughout Greece dreaded as the
most dangerous haunt of Nereids<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>, so that few peasants will cross
a stream or even a dry torrent-bed without making the sign of
the cross. Hardly less risky is it to rest in the shade of any old
or otherwise conspicuous tree. If in addition to this the time of
day be noon, it is not merely venturesome to trespass on such
spots, but inexcusably foolhardy; for the hour of midday slumber
is fraught with as many terrors as the night<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>. Any or all of these
popular beliefs may have been present to Plato’s mind as he wrote
this passage; for the ancients numbered among those Nymphs, by
whom Socrates was likely to be ‘seized,’ both Naiads and Dryads,
who might be expected to resent and to punish any intrusion
upon their haunts in stream or tree; while, as regards the hour of
noon, the fear felt in old time of arousing Pan<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> from his siesta
may well have extended also to Nymphs, who on this spot beside
the Ilissus, as commonly elsewhere, were named his comrades.</p>

<p>The same kind of ‘seizure’ was denoted formerly by the phrase
<span class="greek">ἔχει ἀπ’ ἔξω</span><a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, ‘he has it (i.e. a stroke or seizure) from without,’ and
the modern compound <span class="greek">’ξωπαρμένος</span><a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> bears obviously a kindred
meaning. The exact significance of <span class="greek">ἔξω</span> in this relation is
difficult to determine. Either it is only another example of the
usage already noted in discussing the term <span class="greek">ἐξωτικά</span> and implies
the activity of one of those supernatural beings who exist side by
side with the powers of Christianity and are by their very name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
proved to be pagan; or else it indicates a difference in the mode of
injury by two classes of supernatural foes, the difference between
‘seizure’ and ‘possession.’ Certainly no story is known to me of
‘possession’ by Nereids in the same sense as by devils. The latter
take up their abode within a man and are subject to exorcism;
the seizure by Nereids is conceived rather as an external act of
violence. This is made clear by several terms locally used of
seizure. ‘He has been struck’ (<span class="greek">βαρέθηκε</span> or <span class="greek">χτυπήθηκε</span>), ‘he
has been wounded’ (<span class="greek">λαβώθηκε</span>), ‘he has had hands laid upon
him’ (<span class="greek">ἐγγίχτηκε</span>) are typical expressions, to which is sometimes
added ‘by Nereids’ or ‘by evil women<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.’ Such phrases clearly
convict the Nereids of assault and battery rather than of undue
mental influence upon their victims.</p>

<p>Moreover the Nereids, and with them all the surviving pagan
deities, are pictured by the peasant in corporeal form, whereas the
angels&mdash;and there are bad angels, who ‘possess’ men, as well as
good&mdash;are in common speech as well as in the formal dedications
of churches known as <span class="greek">οἱ ἀσώματοι</span>, ‘the Bodiless ones.’ There is
then an essential difference in the nature of these two classes of
beings, which justifies the supposed distinction in their methods of
working. For ‘possession’ proper is the injury inflicted, or rather
infused, by spirits pure and simple; external ‘seizure’ is the work
of corporeal beings. And this distinction was recognised in comparatively
early times; for John of Damascus<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> in speaking of
<span class="greek">στρίγγαι</span>, a peculiarly maleficent kind of witch (of whom more
anon), notes as singular the fact that sometimes they appear
clothed in bodily form and sometimes as mere spirits (<span class="greek">μετὰ σώματος
ἢ γυμνῇ τῇ ψυχῇ</span>). It is then to the second interpretation of
the phrase <span class="greek">ἔχει ἀπ’ ἔξω</span>, as implying external and bodily violence,
that the balance of argument, I think, inclines.</p>

<p>The precautions which may be taken against injury by
Nereids have already been briefly noticed. Amulets, garlic, the
sign of the cross, the invocation of saints&mdash;all these are common
and suitable prophylactics. But above all, in the actual moment
when imminent danger is suspected, the lips, as Phaedrus was
reminded by Socrates, and also the eyes should be close shut;
for in general the principle obtains that the particular organ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
by which there is converse or contact with the Nereids is most
likely to be impaired or destroyed. Apart from this, there is no
precaution more specially adapted for self-defence against the
Nereids than against the evil eye or any other baneful influence;
and with these I have already dealt<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.</p>

<p>But when these precautions are neglected or fail, the mischief
wrought by the Nereids is not necessarily permanent; there are
several cures which may be tried. Sometimes prayers (but not, so
far as I know, a formal exorcism such as the Greek Church provides
for diabolic possession) are recited by a priest over the sufferer in
the church of some suitable saint; or a trial may be made of
sleeping in a church which possesses a wonder-working <i>icon</i>.
Sometimes an offering of honey-cakes sent or carried to the spot
where the misfortune occurred suffices to turn the Nereids from
their wrath and wins them to undo the hurt that they have done;
on such an errand however the bearer of the offering must beware
of looking back to the place where he has once deposited it, lest a
worse fate overtake him than that which he is trying to dispel<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>.
Theodore Bent<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> gives full details of such an offering made in
the island of Ceos. ‘For those,’ he writes, ‘who are supposed
to have been struck by the Nereids when sleeping under a tree,
the following cure is much in vogue. A white cloth is spread on
the spot, and on it is put a plate with bread, honey, and other
sweets, a bottle of good wine, a knife, a fork, an empty glass,
an unburnt candle, and a censer. These things must be brought
by an old woman who utters mystic words and then goes away,
that the Nereids may eat undisturbed, and that in their
good humour they may allow the sufferer to regain his health.’
How mystic may be the words of a Cean witch, I cannot say; but
the formula to be used by mothers in Chios in the event of a
similar misfortune to a child is extremely simple: ‘Good day to
you, good queens, eat ye the little cakes and heal my child’&mdash;<span class="greek">καλημέρα
σας, καλαὶς ἀρχόντισσαις, φᾶτε σεῖς τὰ κουλουράκια καὶ
’γιάνετε τὸ παιδί μου</span><a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. But the most frequent and most efficacious
method of cure (with which the offering of honeycakes may be
combined) is for the sufferer to revisit the scene of his calamity at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the same hour of the same day in week, month, or year, when by
some capricious reversal of fate the presence of the Nereids is apt
to remove the hurt which it formerly inflicted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far I have dealt with the main characteristics of nymphs
in general: it remains to consider the several classes into which
they were anciently divided; and though for the most part the old
appellations, Nereids, Naiads, Oreads, and Dryads, have either
disappeared or else changed their form or meaning, we shall find
that the old division of them into these four main classes according
to their habitation still to some extent survives.</p>

<p>The Nereids, whose name is now extended to comprise all
kinds of nymphs, are in the ancient and proper sense of the term
among the rarest of whom the peasant speaks. But here and
there mention is made of genuine sea-nymphs, and also of their

In 1826 a villager of Argolis described to Soutzos, the historian of
the Greek revolution<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>, a true Nereid. Her hair was green and
adorned with pearls and corals; often by moonlight she might be
seen dancing merrily on the surface of the sea, and in the daytime
she would come to dry her clothes upon the rocks near the mills of
Lerna. These, I may add from my own knowledge, are reputed to
be haunted by Nereids down to this day. Happily a peasant
of that period cannot be suspected of any education; he was not
recalling a piece of repetition mastered at school when he spoke of</p>

<p>but knew by tradition from his ancestors what Horace learnt of
them by study.</p>

<p>In the Greek town of Sinasos also, in Cappadocia, a class
of sea-nymphs is popularly recognised and distinguished under
the name <span class="greek">Ζαβέται</span>, a word said by the recorder of it to be
derived from a Cappadocian word <i>zab</i> meaning the ‘sea<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>.’ But
of the districts known to me the most fertile in stories of sea-nymphs
is the province of Maina, the middle of the three peninsulas
south of the Peloponnese. One such story attaches to a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
palm-tree growing on the beach at Liméni, a small port on the
west coast of the peninsula. A full version of it has been published<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>,
but as it is long and not peculiarly instructive, I content
myself with an abridgement of it.</p>

<p>A fisherman of Liméni was sleeping one summer night in
his boat; at midnight he suddenly awoke to find Nereids rowing
him out to sea, but happily, remembering at once that Nereids
drown any one whom they catch looking at them, he lay quiet as if
asleep. The boat travelled like lightning, and soon they reached
Arabia; and having shipped a cargo of dates, the Nereids started
home again. As they were returning, one Nereid proposed to
drown the man; but the others replied that he had not opened his
eyes to see them, and that they owed him a debt besides for
the use of his boat. Finally they arrived at some unknown place
and unloaded the dates; and then in a flash the fisherman found
himself back at the shore by the monastery of Liméni, and ‘the
she-devils, the Nereids,’ gone. As he baled out his boat, he found
one date; but suspecting that it had been left intentionally by the
Nereids to cause him trouble, he threw it, not into the sea, for
fear his fishing should suffer, but ashore. And since the date had
been handled by supernatural beings (<span class="greek">’ξωτικά</span>), it could not perish,
but took root where it fell; and hence the palm-tree on the shore
to this day.</p>

<p>These same sea-nymphs&mdash;<span class="greek">θαλασσιναὶς νεράϊδες</span>&mdash;play also a
part in the daily life of the people of this district<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. It is said that
every Saturday night these Nereids join battle with the Nereids
of the mountains, and according as these or those win, their
<i>protégés</i>, the upland or the maritime population, are found on
Sunday morning in higher or lower spirits, booty-laden or despoiled.
It is indeed an imaginative folk which can thus make its deities
responsible for drunken brawls and sober thefts; but some of
them have humour enough to smile at their own imaginings.</p>

<p>A class of maleficent beings known to the inhabitants of
Tenos, Myconos, Amorgos, and other islands of the same group
under the name of <span class="greek">ἀγιελοῦδες</span> or <span class="greek">γιαλοῦδες</span><a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>, have been reckoned as
sea-nymphs by several writers, who would derive the name from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
<span class="greek">’γιαλός</span> (i.e. <span class="greek">αἰγιαλός</span>), the ‘sea-shore<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.’ But there is no evidence
advanced to show that the common-folk regard them as a species
of Nereid; and there is, on the contrary, evidence of their identity
with certain female demons whose name more commonly appears
in the form <span class="greek">γελλοῦδες</span><a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>, and with whom I shall deal later.</p>

<p>The Oreads are no longer known under their old name, but
their existence is still recognised throughout the mainland of
Greece. Their change of name is the result merely of a change
in the ordinary word for ‘mountain.’ Anciently <span class="greek">ὄρος</span> was usual,
<span class="greek">βουνός</span> rare; now the peasant uses commonly <span class="greek">βουνό</span>, and <span class="greek">ὄρος</span>
although understood everywhere and occurring in popular poetry
comes less readily to his lips. Hence the Oreads are now called
<span class="greek">ᾑ Βουνήσι̯αις</span><a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> (sc. <span class="greek">νεράϊδες</span>) or <span class="greek">τὰ κουρίτσια τοῦ βουνοῦ</span><a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> (‘the
mountain-nymphs’ or ‘the maidens of the mount’). These
mountain-nymphs delight in dance and merriment even more
than their kin of the rivers and of the sea. In Maina indeed
they seem to have become infected with the pugnacious character
of the people, for as we have seen they there do battle with
the sea-nymphs each Saturday night. But in general frolic is
more to their taste than fighting. On the heights of Taÿgetus
are three Oreads, well known to the dwellers in the plain of
Sparta, who dance together without pause. On the summit of
Hymettus too there is a flat space, called in the modern Attic
dialect a <span class="greek">πλάτωμα</span> and in shape ‘round like a threshing-floor,’
where Nereids of the mountain dance at midday<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>. Above all
in the uplands of Acarnania and Aetolia many are the hollows
or tree-encircled level spaces which the shepherds will point out
as <span class="greek">νεραϊδάλωνα</span>, ‘threshing-floors’ where the nymphs make merry;
for a threshing-floor, it must be remembered, is the usual resort
for dancing, wrestling, and all those amusements for which a level
space is required.</p>

<p>Nymphs of the same kind are known also in Crete. A curious
story of a wedding procession in which they took part was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
narrated to Pashley<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>, and his informant’s words are recorded by
him in the original dialect. ‘Once upon a time a man told
me that two men had once gone up to the highest mountain-ridges,
where wild goats live, and sat by moonlight in a grassy
hollow<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> (<span class="greek">διασέλι</span>), in the hopes of shooting the goats. And there
they heard a great noise, and supposed that there were men come
to get loads of snow to carry to Canea. But when they drew
nearer, they heard violins and cithers and all kinds of music, and
such music they had never heard. So they knew at once that
these were no men but an assemblage of divine beings (<span class="greek">δαιμονικὸ
συνέδριον</span>). And they watched them and saw them pass at a
short distance from where they were sitting, clothed in all manner
of raiment, and mounted some on grey horses and some on horses
of other colours, and they could make out that there were men and
women, afoot or riding, a very host. And the men were white
as doves, and the women very beautiful like the rays of the sun.
They saw too that they were carrying something in the way that a
dead body is carried out. Forthwith the mountaineers determined
to have a shot at them as they passed before them. They had
heard also a song of which the words were</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go we to fetch a bride, a lady bride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the steep rock, a bride that is alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And they made up their minds and fired a shot at them. Thereupon
those that were in front cried out with one voice, “What is
it?” and those behind answered, “Our bridegroom is slain, our
bridegroom is slain.” And they wept and cried aloud and fled.’</p>

<p>In regard to this story it may be noted that a male form
of Nereid (<span class="greek">Νεραΐδης</span>) is sometimes mentioned, and here such are
undoubtedly implied. The necessity of finding husbands for the
Nereids naturally presents itself to the minds of the old women
who are the chief story-tellers, and the demand is met by an
assorted supply of young men, male Nereids, and devils. As
consorts of the last-mentioned, the Nereids enjoy in many places
the title of <span class="greek">διαβόλισσαις</span>, ‘she-devils’; and it was on the ground of
such unions that a peasant-woman of Acarnania once explained to
me the belief, held in her own village, that Nereids were seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
only at midday. How should the devils their husbands let such
beautiful women be abroad at night?</p>

<p>It is on the mountain-nymphs also that the peasants most
frequently lay the responsibility for whirlwinds<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>, by which children
or even adults are said to be caught up and carried from one place
to another<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>, or to their death. Some such fate, we must suppose,
in ancient times also was held to have befallen a seven-year-old boy
on whose tomb was written, ‘Tearful Hades with the help of
Oreads made away with me, and this mournful tomb that has
been builded nigh unto the Nymphs contains me<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.’ The habit of
travelling on a whirlwind, or more correctly perhaps of stirring up
a whirlwind by rapid passage, has gained for the nymphs in some
districts secondary names&mdash;in Macedonia <span class="greek">ἀνεμικαίς</span>, in Gortynia
<span class="greek">ἀνεμογαζοῦδες</span><a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>&mdash;which might almost seem to constitute a new
class of wind-nymphs. But so far as I know the faculty of raising
whirlwinds, though most frequently exercised by Oreads, is common
to all nymphs.</p>

<p>In Athens whirlwinds are said to occur most frequently near
the old Hill of the Nymphs<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>: and women of the lower classes,
as they see the spinning spiral of dust approach, fall to crossing
themselves busily and to repeating <span class="greek">μέλι καὶ γάλα ’στὴ στράτα σας</span><a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
(or <span class="greek">’στο δρόμο σας</span>), ‘Honey and milk in your path!’ This incantation
is widely known as an effective safeguard against the
Nereids in their rapid flight, and must in origin, it would seem,
have been a vow. This supposition is confirmed by the fact that
in Corfu<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> a few decades ago the peasantry used to make actual
offerings of both milk and honey to the Nereids, and that
Theocritus also associates these two gifts in vows made to the
nymphs and to Pan. ‘I will set,’ sings Lacon, ‘a great bowl
of white milk for the nymphs, and another will I set full of sweet
oil’; to which Comatas in rivalry rejoins, ‘Eight pails of milk will
I set for Pan, and eight dishes of honey in the honeycomb<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.’ The
gift of honey is of special significance. In every recorded case which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
I know of offerings to Nereids in modern Greece honey is expressly
mentioned, and seems indeed to be essential; and it is probably
from their known preference for this food that at Kastoria in
Macedonia they have even received the by-name, <span class="greek">ᾑ μελιτένιαις</span>,
‘the honeyed ones<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.’ And if we look back over many centuries
we may find a hint of the same belief in Homer’s description
of the cave of the Naiads in Ithaca, wherein ‘are bowls for
mixing and pitchers of stone, and there besides do bees make
store<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.’ For it is well established that honey was the special
offering made to the indigenous deities of Greece before the
making of wine such as Homer’s heroes quaff had yet been
discovered<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>. Perchance then even in distant pre-Homeric days
men vowed, as now they vow, honey and milk to the nymphs
whose swift passing was the whirlwind, and felt secure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The memory of the tree-nymphs is still green throughout
Greece. From Aegina their ancient name <span class="greek">δρυάδες</span> is recorded
as still in use<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>; and in parts of Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and
Thrace, as well as in several islands of the Aegean Sea, Chios,
Cimolos, Cythnos, and others, there is a word employed which is, I
believe, formed from the same root and once denoted the same class
of beings. This word is found in the forms <span class="greek">δρύμαις</span><a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>, <span class="greek">δρύμιαις</span><a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>,
<span class="greek">δρύμναις</span><a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>, <span class="greek">δρύμνιαις</span><a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> and, in Chios, in a neuter form <span class="greek">δρύματα</span><a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>.</p>

<p>It has been suggested indeed by one writer<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> that this word has
nothing to do with Dryads, but that its root is <span class="greek">δρυμ-</span> (better
perhaps written <span class="greek">δριμ-</span> as in the ancient <span class="greek">δριμύς</span>, since, so far as the
sound of the vowel in modern Greek is concerned, the philologist
may write <span class="greek">η, ι, υ, ει, οι</span>, or <span class="greek">υι</span>, as seemeth him best), in the sense
of ‘fierce,’ ‘bitter’; and support for this derivation is sought in
a somewhat vague statement of Hesychius who explains the word
<span class="greek">δρυμίους</span> by the phrase <span class="greek">τοὺς κατὰ τὴν χώραν κακοποιούς</span>, ‘the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
evil-doers in the country’: but whether he took <span class="greek">δρυμίους</span> to be
the proper name of some class of demons, or an adjective synonymous
with <span class="greek">κακοποιός</span>, does not appear.</p>

<p>But even on the grounds of form alone (which grounds will
be considerably strengthened when we come to consider signification),
it appears better to derive this group of words from <span class="greek">δρῦς</span>
or more immediately from <span class="greek">δρυμός</span>, ‘a coppice’; for in ancient
literature mention is made of ‘Artemis of the coppice’ and
‘nymphs of the coppice’ (<span class="greek">Ἄρτεμις δρυμονία</span><a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and <span class="greek">δρυμίδες
νύμφαι</span>)<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>, of a particular nymph named Drymo<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>, of a <span class="greek">Ζεὺς δρύμνιος</span><a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
worshipped in Pamphylia, and of Apollo invoked at Miletus
under the title <span class="greek">δρύμας</span><a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>. In the last two instances the title may
be supposed to have had reference merely to the surroundings of
a particular sanctuary; but in relation to Artemis and the nymphs
the epithet clearly suggests their woodland haunts.</p>

<p>In present-day usage the words which we are considering almost
universally denote, not nymphs or any other supernatural beings,
but the first few days of August, which are observed in a special
way. The number of these days varies from three in Sinasos<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>,
in Carpathos<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>, and in Syme (an island north of Rhodes), to
five in Cythnos<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> and Cyprus<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>, and six in most other places
where they are specially observed. There are two rules laid
down for this observance, though in some places only one of the
two is in force: no tree may be peeled or cut (this is the usual
practice for obtaining mastic and resin); and the use of water
for washing either the person or clothes is prohibited; neither
is it permitted to travel by water during this period. In the
interests of personal cleanliness it is unfortunate that the month
of August should have been selected for this abstention; by that
time even the Greeks find the sea tepid enough to admit of
bathing without serious risk of chill, and it is a pity therefore
that a penalty should be inflicted upon bathers during the first
week of the only month in which ablutions extend beyond the
pouring of a small jug of water over the fingers. Howbeit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
decrees stand, and as surely as there is transgression thereof, skin
will blister and peel off, clothes will rot<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>, and trees will wither.
The severity of these pains has in Cyprus changed the name of
these days from <span class="greek">δρύμαις</span> into <span class="greek">κακαουσκιαίς</span>, ‘the evil days of
August<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>.’</p>

<p>Now among a people so superstitious as the Greeks it is
reasonable to suppose that days thus marked by special abstinences
were originally sacred to some deities. Washing and
tree-cutting at this season must, we may assume, have been
offences against some supernatural persons whose festival was then
observed and who avenged its profanation; and the supernatural
persons most nearly concerned would naturally be the tree-nymphs
and the water-nymphs.</p>

<p>The association or even confusion of these two classes of
nymphs is very common both in ancient literature and in modern
belief, and is indeed a natural consequence of the fact that the
finest trees, such as that plane under which sat Socrates and
Phaedrus, grow only in the close vicinity of water. It would
have puzzled even Socrates to say whether the Nymphs by whom
he might be seized would be more probably Dryads or Naiads.
Homer himself, to go yet further back, suggests the same association,
for he tells of ‘a spreading olive-tree and nigh thereto’ the
cave of the Naiads in Ithaca. Again in later times we find a
dedication by one Cleonymus to ‘Hamadryads, daughters of the
river’<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>; and though an ingenious critic would replace <span class="greek">Ἁμαδρυάδες</span>
by <span class="greek">Ἀνιγριάδες</span> (nymphs of the Arcadian river Anigrus), I
believe the fault to lie with Cleonymus and not with the manuscript;
for the place where he makes his dedication is beneath
pine-trees (<span class="greek">ὑπαὶ πιτύων</span>). At the present day the same tendency
towards confusion of the two classes is common. This was well
illustrated to me by some peasants of Tenos. Ten minutes’ walk
from the town there is a good spring from which a remarkable
subterranean passage cut through the solid rock carries the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
to supply the town. The spring is within a cave, artificially enlarged
at the entrance, over which stands a fine fig-tree. Standing
outside while a companion entered first, I noticed that our guides
(for several persons had escorted us out of curiosity or hospitality)
were distinctly perturbed, and I heard one say to another, ‘See, he
is going in, he is not afraid.’ Inferring thence that the place was
haunted, and remembering that mid-day, the hour at which we
happened to be there, was fraught with special peril, I determined
to test my guides, and so sat down under the fig-tree. Then remarking
that the sun was hot at noon, I invited them to come
and sit in the shade and smoke a cigarette. But the bait was insufficient;
they would stand in the sun rather than approach either
the spring or the tree, though they were ready enough to accept
cigarettes when I moved out of the zone of danger. Afterwards by
enquiries made elsewhere I learnt that the spot was the reputed
home of Nereids&mdash;but whether their abode was tree or water, who
should say? Close neighbours in their habitations, indistinguishable
in their appearance and attributes, it is pardonable to
confuse those sister nymphs,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Centum quae siluas, centum quae flumina seruant<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is exactly this kind of confusion of the two classes of nymphs
which has produced the twofold injunctions for the observance of
the days known as <span class="greek">δρύμαις</span>: for evidence is forthcoming that this
word originally denoted a class of nymphs and not, as generally
now, their August festival. From Stenimachos in Thrace comes
the statement that by <span class="greek">δρύμιαις</span> the people there understand female
deities who live in water and are always hostile to man, but
specially dangerous only during the first six days of August<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>.
Here the name <span class="greek">δρύμιαις</span>, if the derivation which I prefer is right,
points to the identification of these beings with the ancient
Dryads; while their watery habitations proclaim them rather
Naiads. Reversely again in Syme, where the word <span class="greek">δρύμαις</span> is
not in use, there are certain nymphs known as <span class="greek">Ἀλουστίναι</span> who
live in mountain-torrents, in trees, and elsewhere, and who are
seen only at mid-day and at midnight during the first three days
of August; but, far from being hurtful to men, they may even themselves
be captured by certain magical ceremonies and employed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
servants in the house for a period, after which the spell is broken
and they return again to their homes. Their name <span class="greek">Ἀλουστίναι</span><a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>,
said to be formed from <span class="greek">Ἀλούστος</span><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>, the local name for the month
of August, clearly means ‘anti-washing,’ and at once identifies
them with those Naiads whose festival, as I believe, has rendered
the waters sacred and therefore harmful if disturbed during these
days; but on the other hand their dwelling-places include trees.
These two pieces of evidence from places so wide apart as Stenimachos
and Syme are reinforced by a popular expression formerly,
and perhaps still, in use, <span class="greek">τὸν ἔπι̯ασαν ᾑ δρύμαις</span><a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>, ‘the “drymes”
have seized him’; where the word denoting ‘seizure’ is one of
those already noted as proper to ‘seizure’ by nymphs.</p>

<p>From the usage of the word therefore as well as from its
formation we may conclude that the word <span class="greek">δρύμαις</span> is the modern
equivalent of the ancient <span class="greek">δρυάδες</span>: and the widely-spread custom
of abstaining both from tree-cutting and from the use of water
during the early days of August is a survival of an old joint
festival of wood-nymphs and water-nymphs.</p>

<p>But it is not in the relics of ancient worship only that traces of
the Dryads are now to be found. The traveller in Greece will
commonly hear that such and such a tree is haunted by a Nereid.
Particularly famous in North Arcadia is a magnificent pine-tree on
the path from the monastery of Megaspélaeon to the village of
Solos. My muleteer enthusiastically compared it to the gigantic
tree which is believed to uphold the world; and piously crossed
himself, as we passed it, for fear of the nymph who made it her
home. In general the trees thus reputed are the fruit-bearing
trees which were comprehensively denoted by the term <span class="greek">δρῦς</span>, from
which the Dryads took their name&mdash;the fig-tree, the olive, the
holly-oak<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>, and the plane. Such trees, especially when conspicuous
for age or for luxuriance, are readily suspected to be the abode of
Nereids. One Nereid only, it would seem, is assigned to each
tree (though, if her retreat be violated, she may swiftly call others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
of her kind to aid her in taking vengeance), and with the life of
the tree her own life is bound up.</p>

<p>For a nymph is not immortal. Her span of life far exceeds that
of man, but none the less it is measured. ‘A crow lives twice as
long as a man, a tortoise twice as long as a crow, and a Nereid twice
as long as a tortoise.’ Such is a popular saying which I heard from
an unlettered peasant of Arcadia, to whom evidently had been transmitted
orally through many centuries a version of Hesiod’s lines,
‘Verily nine times the age of men in their prime doth the croaking
raven live; and a stag doth equal four ravens; and ’tis three lives
of a stag ere the crow grows old; but the phoenix hath the life of
nine crows; and ye, fair-tressed Nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing
Zeus, do live ten times the phoenix’ age<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.’ Commenting
on this passage, Plutarch takes the word <span class="greek">γενεά</span> in the phrase
<span class="greek">ἐννέα γενεὰς ἀνδρῶν ἡβώντων</span>, which I have rendered as ‘nine
times the age of men in their prime,’ to be used as the equivalent
of <span class="greek">ἐνιαυτός</span>, a year; and, making a sober computation on this basis,
discovers that the limit of life for nymphs and <i>daemones</i> in general
is 9720 years. But he then admits that the mass of men do not
allow so long a duration, and quotes by way of illustration a
phrase from Pindar, <span class="greek">νύμφας ... ἰσοδένδρου τέκμωρ αἰῶνος λαχούσας</span>,
according to which the nymphs are allotted a term of life
commensurate with that of a tree; hence, it is added, the
compound name <span class="greek">Ἁμαδρυάδες</span>, Dryads whose lives are severally
bound up with those of the trees which they inhabit<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>. Other
ancient authorities concur. Sophocles markedly calls the nymphs
of Mt Cithaeron ‘long-lived’ (<span class="greek">μακραιῶνες</span>), not ‘immortal’<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>: Pliny
certifies the finding of dead Nereids on the coasts of Gaul during
the reign of Augustus<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>: Tzetzes cites from the works of Charon
of Lampsacus the story of an Hamadryad who was in danger
of being swept away and drowned by a swollen mountain-torrent<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>:
and, to revert to yet earlier authority, in one of the Homeric
Hymns Aphrodite rehearses to Anchises the whole matter<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.
Speaking of the son whom she will bear to him, she says: ‘So
soon as he shall see the light of the sun, he shall be tended by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
deep-bosomed nymphs of the mountains, even those that dwell
upon this high and holy mount. These verily are neither of
mortal men nor of immortal gods. Long indeed they live and
feed on food divine, and they have strength too for fair dance
amid immortals; yea, and with them have the watchful Slayer of
Argus and such as Silenus been joined in love within the depths
of pleasant grots. But at the moment of their birth, there spring
up upon the nurturing earth pines, may be, or oaks rearing high
their heads, good trees and luxuriant, upon the mountain-heights.
Far aloft they tower; sanctuaries of immortals they are called,
and men hew them not with axe<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>. But so soon as the doom
of death stands beside them, first the good trees are dried up
at the root and then their bark withers about them and their
branches fall away, and therewith the soul of the nymphs too
leaves the light of the sun.’</p>

<p>So my Arcadian friend was true to ancient tradition both in
his estimate of the life of Nereids and in his belief, thereby
implied, that they are mortal. Nor is other modern testimony
wanting. There are popular stories still current concerning
Nereids’ deaths. One has been recorded in which a Nereid is
struck by God with lightning and slain as a punishment for
stealing a boy from his father, and her sister nymphs in terror
restore the child<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>. A pertinent confession of faith has also
been heard from the lips of a Cretan peasant. In explanation
of the name <span class="greek">Νεραϊδόσπηλος</span>, ‘Nereid-grot,’ attached to a cave
near his village, he had related a story of a Nereid who was
carried off from that spot and taken to wife by a young man,
to whom she bore a son; but as she would never open her
lips in his presence, he went in despair to an old woman who
advised him to heat an oven hot and then taking the child in his
arms to say to the Nereid, ‘Speak to me; or I will burn your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
child,’ and so saying to make show of throwing the child into the
oven. He did as the old woman advised; but the Nereid saying
only, ‘You hound, leave my child alone,’ seized it from him and
disappeared. And since the other Nereids would not admit her
again to their company in the cave, as being now a mother,
she took up her abode in a spring close by; and there she is seen
two or three times a year holding the child in her arms. ‘After
hearing this tale,’ says the recorder of it, ‘I asked the old peasant
who told it me, how long ago this had happened.’ He replied that
he had heard it from his grandfather, and guessed it to be about
a hundred and sixty years. ‘My good man,’ said the other,
‘would not the child have grown up in all that time?’ ‘What do
you suppose, sir?’ he answered; ‘are those to grow up so easily
who live from a thousand to fifteen hundred years?<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>’</p>

<p>How this period was computed by the Cretan peasant, or
whether it was computed at all on any system known to him,
is not related; but very probably the longevity of trees was the
original basis of the calculation; for the peasants will often point
out some old contorted olive-trunk as a thousand or more years
old; I was once even taken to see a tree reputed to have been
planted by Alexander the Great. But at any rate it is clear that
both in ancient and in modern times the nymphs have always been
believed to be subject to ultimate death, and however the tenure of
life may be determined in the case of the others, the Dryads have
without doubt been generally reckoned coeval with the trees that
are their homes.</p>

<p>An exception to this rule must however be made in the case of
Nereid-haunted trees which do not die a natural death, but are felled
untimely. A Nymph’s life is not to be cut short by a humanly-wielded
axe. In the Homeric Hymn indeed, which I have quoted,
we learn that men hew not such trees with steel; and the same
might, I think, be said at the present day with certainty of those
trees which are known to be haunted. But the unknown is ever full
of risk; and the woodcutter of the North Arcadian forests, mindful
of the sacrilege which he may commit and fearful of the vengeance
wherewith it may be visited, takes such precautions as piety
suggests. With muttered appeals to the Panagia or his own
patron-saint and with much crossing of himself he fills up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
moments between each bout of hewing at any suspected tree
(unfortunately the finest timber on which he plies his axe is
also the most likely to harbour a Nereid) and finally as the
upper branches sway and the tree trembles to its fall, he runs
back and throws himself down with his face to the ground, in
silence which not even a prayer must break, lest a Nereid,
passing out from her violated abode, hear and espy and punish.
For, as has been said before, nothing is more sure than that he who
speaks in the hearing of a Nereid loses from thenceforth the power
of speech; while the practice of hiding the face in the ground is
not a foolish imitation of the ostrich, but is prompted by the belief
that a Nereid is most prone to injure those who by look, word, or
touch have of their own act, though not always of their own will,
placed themselves in communication or contact with her<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<p>These precautions appertaining to the lore of modern Greek
forestry indicate a belief that, when a tree is hewn down, its
death does not involve the death of the Nereid within it, but that
she escapes alive and vengeful. And herein once more there
is agreement between the beliefs of modern and of ancient Greece.
Apollonius Rhodius tells the story of the want and penury which
befell Paraebius for all his labours. ‘Verily he was paying a cruel
requital for the sin of his father; who once when he was felling
trees, alone upon the mountains, made light of the prayers of
an Hamadryad. For she with tears and passionate speech strove
to soften his heart, that he should not hew the trunk of her coeval
oak, wherein she lived continuously her whole long life; but he
right foolishly did fell the tree, in pride of his young strength.
Wherefore the Nymph set a doom of fruitless toil thereafter
on him and on his children<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Naiads, of whose ancient name, so far as I know, no trace
remains in the dialects of to-day, are not less numerous than other
nymphs and as much to be feared. The peasants speak of them
usually as ‘Nereids of the river’ or ‘of the spring’ (<span class="greek">νεράϊδες τοῦ
ποταμίου</span> or <span class="greek">τῆς βρύσης</span>); and only in one place, Kephalóvryso
(‘Fountain-head’) in Aetolia, did I find a distinctive by-name for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
them. This was the word <span class="greek">ξεραμμέναις</span><a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>, which I take to be a
half-humorous euphemism meaning ‘the Parched Ones’; but,
so far as sound is concerned, it would be equally permissible
to write <span class="greek">’ξεραμέναις</span> (past participle of <span class="greek">’ξερνῶ</span> = Latin <i>respuo</i>) and
to interpret therefore in the sense of ‘the Abominable Ones.’
The latter appellation however seems to me too outspoken in
view of the awe in which the Naiads are everywhere held.</p>

<p>Wherever fresh water is, whether in mountain-torrent or
reservoir, in river or village-well, there is peril to be feared; no
careful mother will send her children at noontide to fetch water
from the spring, or, if they are sent, they must at least spit
thrice into it before they dip their pitchers, nor will she suffer
them to loiter beside a stream when dusk has fallen; no cautious
man will ford a river without crossing himself first on the brink.</p>

<p>The actual dwelling-place of these nymphs may be either the
depths of the water itself or some cave beside the stream. Homer
gave to the Naiads of Ithaca for their habitation a grotto, wherein
were everflowing waters<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>; and though in some cases the nymphs
who haunt the mountain caves may as well be Oreads as Naiads,
I have preferred to deal with them in this place; for usually it is
river-gods who have hollowed out these rocky homes for their
daughters, and in many such caves may be seen the everflowing
waters that attest the Naiads’ birthright.</p>

<p>Some such places, whether springs or caves, have, as might be
expected, attained greater fame or notoriety than others; some
special incident starts a story about them which from generation
to generation rolls on gathering it may be fresh volume.</p>

<p>A typical story&mdash;typical save only for the absence of tragedy,
since the Naiads are wont to drown by mistake those whom they
carry off&mdash;was heard by Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> from what he considered
a trustworthy source. ‘Some well-to-do people of Chios were
taking a summer holiday in the country <i>en famille</i>, when a pretty
little girl of the party got separated from the rest and ran off to a
well at a little distance. Amusing herself, as children will, she
leant forward over the well, and as she was looking at the water
in it, was, without perceiving it, insensibly lifted by some force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and pushed into the well. Her relations saw her carried off, and
running up, perceived the girl amusing herself on the top of the
water as if she were seated on a bed. Thereupon her father,
emboldened by the sight, tried to climb down into the well,
but was pulled in by some force and set beside his child. In
the meantime some of the others had brought a ladder, which
they lowered into the well and bade the man ascend. Catching up
his daughter in his arms, he mounted the ladder safe and sound,
and to the amazement of all, though father and daughter had been
all that time in the water, they came out with clothes perfectly
dry, without so much as a trace of dampness. The seizure of the
girl and her father they attributed to Nereids, who were said
to haunt that well. The girl too herself asserted that while she
was hanging over the well, she had seen women sporting on
the surface of the water with the utmost animation, and at their
invitation had voluntarily thrown herself in.’</p>

<p>This story, though it ends happily, bears a marked resemblance
to that of Hylas. It is specially noted that the child had a pretty
face, and this without doubt is conceived as impelling the Nereids
to seize her. It is of little consequence that their home is, in this
case, a mere well instead of ‘a spring,’ as Theocritus<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> pictures
it, ‘in a hollow of the land, whereabout grew rushes thickly and
purple cuckoo-flower<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> and pale maidenhair and bright green parsley
and clover spreading wide’; for the ancients also attributed
nymphs to their wells<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>.</p>

<p>Such stories are sometimes causes, sometimes effects, of the
not uncommon place-names <span class="greek">νεραϊδόβρυσι, νεραϊδόσπηλῃ͜ο</span><a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>, ‘Nereid-spring,’
‘Nereid-cave.’</p>

<p>Two such caves, to which the additional interest attaches
of having been in classical times also regarded as holy ground, are
found on Parnassus and on Olympus. The former is the famous
Corycian cave sacred in antiquity to Pan and the Nymphs<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
still dreaded by the inhabitants of the district as an abode of
Nereids<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. The latter is thought to be the ancient sanctuary
of the Pierian Muses, and the peasants of the last generation held
the place in such awe that they refused to conduct anyone thither
for fear of being seized with madness<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. It is right to add that the
tenants of this cavern were called by the vague name <span class="greek">ἐξωτικαίς</span>,
which would comprise not only Nereids, but presumably the Muses
also, if any remembrance of them survives in the district; but the
fear of being seized with madness suggests the ordinary conception
of nymphs. In neither of these instances of course can it be
claimed that Naiads rather than Oreads are the possessors of the
cave; but as I have said the peasants generally employ the wide
appellation ‘Nereids’ or some yet vaguer name, and do not
discriminate between the looks and the qualities of the several
orders of nymphs. It is only by observing local and occasional
distinctions that I have been able to trace some survivals of the
four main ancient classes. In general the ‘Nereid’ of to-day is
simply the ‘Nymph’ of antiquity.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 10. <span class="smcap">The Queens of the Nymphs.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Travelling once in a small sailing-boat from the island of
Scyros to Scopelos I overheard an instructive conversation between
one of my two boatmen and a shepherd whom we had
taken off from the small island of Skánzoura. The occasion of
our touching there, namely pursuit by pirates (from whom the
North Aegean is not yet wholly free, though their piracies are
seldom of a worse nature than cattle-lifting from the coasts and
islands), had certainly had an exciting effect upon my boatman’s
nerves, and, as darkness fell, the shepherd responded to his companion’s
mood, and their talk ranged over many strange experiences.
Very soon they were exchanging confidences about
the supernatural beings with whom they had come into contact;
and among these figured two who are the queens respectively of
the nymphs of land and of sea. Of these deities one only was
known to each of the speakers, but on comparing notes they
agreed that the two personalities were distinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>The landsman told of one whom he named ‘the queen of the
mountains’ (<span class="greek">ἡ βασίλισσα τῶν βουνῶν</span>) who with a retinue of
Nereids was ever roaming over the hills or dancing in some
wooded dell. In form she was as a Nereid, but taller and more
glistening-white than they; and as she surpassed her comrades in
beauty, so did she also excel in cruelty towards those who heedlessly
crossed her path. The sailor on the other hand had both
seen and heard one whom he called ‘the queen of the shore’ (<span class="greek">ἡ
βασίλισσα τοῦ γιαλοῦ</span>). Most often she stands in the sea with
the water waist-high about her, and sings passionate love-songs to
those who pass by on the shore. Then must men close fast their
eyes and stop their ears; for, if they yield to her seductions, the
bridal bed is in the depths of the sea and she alone rises up again
to tempt yet others with her fatal love.</p>

<p>The former is without question she of whom Homer sang,
‘In company with her do mirthful nymphs ... range o’er the land....
High above them all she carries her head and brow, and full
easily is she known, though they all be beautiful’<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.</p>

<p>Nigh on three thousand years ago was composed this graceful
epitome of beliefs still current to-day; for, though the name of
Artemis is no longer heard, her personality remains. The peasants
in general describe rather than name her. In Zacynthos she is
called ‘the great lady’ (<span class="greek">ἡ μεγάλη κυρά</span>)<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>; in Cephalonia and in
the villages of Parnassus she is distinguished simply as ‘the
chief’ or ‘the greatest’ of the Nereids<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>; in either Chios or
Scopelos (I cannot say which, for my shepherd had been born in
the former but was then living in the latter) her title is ‘Queen of
the mountains.’ In Aetolia however I was fortunate enough to
hear an actual name assigned, <span class="greek">ἡ κυρὰ Κάλω</span>, ‘the lady Beautiful,’
where the shift of the accent in <span class="greek">Κάλω</span> as compared with the
adjective <span class="greek">καλός</span> is natural to the formation of a proper name, and
the feminine termination in <span class="greek">-ω</span>, almost obsolete now, argues an
early origin. The name therefore in its present form may have
come down unchanged from classical times; but, whatever its
age, we may at least hear in it an echo of the ancient cult-title of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Artemis, <span class="greek">Καλλίστη</span>, ‘most beautiful’<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>. The same deity, I suspect,
survived also until recently, under a disguised form but with a
kindred name, in Athens: for the folk there used to tell of one
whom they named ‘Saint Beautiful’ (<span class="greek">ἡ ἅγι̯α Καλή</span>), but to whom
no church was ever dedicated<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>; her canonisation was only popular.</p>

<p>The account which I received in Aetolia of this ‘lady
Beautiful’ agreed closely with the description already given of
‘the queen of the mountains.’ In appearance and in character
she is but a Nereid on a larger scale. All the beauty and the
frowardness so freely imputed to the nymphs are superlatively
hers; there is no safety from her; on hillside, in coppice, by
rivulet, everywhere she may be encountered; the tongue that
makes utterance in her presence is thenceforth tied, and the eyes
that behold her are darkened. The punishment that befell
Teiresias of old for looking upon Athena as she bathed still
awaits those who stray by mischance beside some sequestered pool
or stream where the Nereids and their queen are wont to bathe in
the heat of noon.</p>

<p>Such a spot, favoured in olden time by Artemis and her attendant
Naiads, was the Cretan river Amnisos<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>; and it was probably
no mere coincidence, but a good instance rather of the continuity
of local tradition, that in comparatively recent times her personality
and perhaps even her old name were still known in the
district. It is recorded that in the sixteenth century both priests
and people of the district declared that at a pretty little tarn near
the Gulf of Mirabella they had seen ‘Diana and her fair nymphs’
lay aside their white raiment and bathe and disappear in the
clear waters<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>. It would have been highly interesting to know
the name of the goddess which the Italian writer translated as
‘Diana.’ Though it is true that in Italy<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Diana herself was
still worshipped in magical nightly orgies as late as the fourteenth
century, it is scarcely likely that the Italian name had
been adopted in Crete. More probably the slovenly fashion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
miscalling Greek deities by Latin names was as common then as
now; and in this instance a piece of valuable evidence has thereby
been irretrievably lost. Yet the traditional connexion of Artemis
with this district of Crete warrants the assumption that the leader
of the nymphs of whom the story tells was in personality, if not
also in name, the ancient Greek goddess, and no Italian importation.</p>

<p>Distinct reference to the bathing of Artemis is also made in a
story which has already been related in connexion with Aphrodite
and Eros<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. A prince, who had journeyed to the garden of Eros to
fetch water for the healing of his father’s blindness, saw in the
spring there ‘a woman white as snow and shining as the moon.
And it was in very truth the moon that bathed here.’ The last
sentence, provided always that it be free from modern scholastic
contamination, is an unique example of the survival of Artemis in
the <i>rôle</i> of the moon; while the healing properties of the spring in
which she bathes offer a coincidence, certainly undesigned, with
the powers of the goddess whom her worshippers of yore besought
to ‘banish unto the mountain-tops sickness and suffering’<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>.</p>

<p>Whether ‘the lady Beautiful’ is known now also in her ancient
huntress-guise, is a point not readily determined. In Aetolia
certainly I once or twice heard mention of her hunting on the
mountains, but without feeling sure whether the word ‘hunt’ was
being used literally or in metaphor. Expressions borrowed from
the chase are not uncommon in the language, and the particular
verb <span class="greek">κυνηγῶ</span>, ‘I hunt,’ is in the vernacular used of anything from
rabbit-shooting to wife-beating. The injuries inflicted by Artemis
on those who trespass upon her haunts might possibly be denoted
by the same term. On the other hand it is not in the character
of ‘the lady Beautiful,’ as it is in that of the ‘hunter’ Charos, to
seek men out and slay them; men may fall chance victims to
the sudden anger of the goddess, but they are the chosen quarry
of the other’s prowess; he is a true ‘hunter’ of men, and, try as
they will to evade him, he still pursues; but Artemis strikes none
who turn aside from her path. I incline therefore to believe that
the word ‘to hunt’ was intended literally when I heard it used of
‘the lady Beautiful,’ and that the ancient Artemis’ love of the
chase is not forgotten by the Aetolian peasantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p>Such are the reminiscences of Artemis which I have been able
to gather in a few districts of modern Greece. But it is clear
that down to the seventeenth century the goddess was much
more widely known. Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>, writing about the year 1630,
after giving a good description of the Nereids, plunges abruptly
into a long quotation from Michael Psellus, from which and
from Allatius’ own comments on it some information about the
Queen of the Nereids may be gleaned. The passage in question
runs as follows, the comments and explanations in brackets being
my <span class="lock">own:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘<span class="greek">ἡ καλὴ τὸν ὡραῖον.</span> Supply <span class="greek">ἀπέτεκεν</span>. (Apparently a proverb,
‘Fair mother, fine son,’ to the usage of which Psellus gives some
religious colour.) For the Virgin that brought forth was wonderfully
fair, dazzling in the brightness of her graces, and her son was
exceeding beautiful, fair beyond the sons of men. (Notwithstanding
however the religious significance of the proverb, he at once condemns
the use of it.) As a matter of fact, the phrase is due to
faulty speech. For the popular language has perverted the saying.
It is right to say <span class="greek">καλὴν τῶν ὀρέων</span> (‘fair lady of the mountains’);
but the people have made the saying <span class="greek">καλὴ τὸν ὡραῖον</span> (‘fair mother,
fine son’). (There is no distinction in sound, according to the
modern pronunciation, between <span class="greek">τῶν ὀρέων</span> and <span class="greek">τὸν ὡραῖον</span>.)
Hence we see that the popular imagination had once fashioned,
quite unreasonably, a female deity whose domain was the mountains
and who as it were disported herself upon them....
There is no deity called ‘fair lady of the mountains,’ nor is the
so-called Barychnas a deity at all but a trouble arising in the
head from heartburn or ill-digested food, ... which is also known
as Ephialtes.’</p>

<p>Here Psellus is rambling in his dissertation as wildly as
though his own head were affected by this demoniacal ailment.
Which Allatius observing comments <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘What has Barychnas or Babutzicarius<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> or if you like Ephialtes
to do with the fair lady of the woods or the mountains (<i>pulcram
nemorum sive montium</i>)? From them men suffer lying abed;
whereas attacks such as we have said are made by Callicantzarus<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Burcolacas<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>, or Nereid, occur in the open country and public roadways....
And Psellus himself knew quite well that the ‘fair
lady of the mountains’ was nothing other than those who are
commonly called the ‘fair mistresses’<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> (i.e. Nereids), who have
nothing on earth to do with Barychnas and Ephialtes.’</p>

<p>The argument of this strangely confused passage is happily
beside our mark, and we need not puzzle, with Psellus, over the
demonology of dyspepsia. His interpretation of the phrase <span class="greek">καλὴ
τῶν ὀρέων</span> I have even ventured to omit, for a devious path of
wilful reasoning leads only to the conclusion that it means the
tree on which Christ was crucified. The only method in his mad
medley of medicine and theology is the intention to refute the
popular belief in a beautiful goddess who haunted the mountains.</p>

<p>Some details of the belief may be gathered from Allatius’
criticism of the argument. Psellus mentions only the title <span class="greek">ἡ καλὴ
τῶν ὀρέων</span>, but Allatius amplifies it in the phrase <i>pulcram nemorum
sive montium</i>, implying thereby that in his own time Artemis&mdash;for
it can be none other&mdash;was associated as much with woodland
as with mountain; while her intimate connexion with the Nereids
is adduced as a matter of common knowledge. The somewhat
loose phrase by which Allatius indicates this fact&mdash;<i>pulcram montium
nihil aliud esse quam eas quas vulgus vocat pulcras dominas</i>&mdash;must
not be read in any strict and narrow sense. The beautiful
lady of the mountains is, he means, just such as are the Nereids;
but she is a definite person, distinguished as of old among her
comrades by supreme grace and loveliness.</p>

<p>The statements of Leo Allatius, based as they are in the main
upon his own recollections of his native Chios, find remarkable
corroboration in a history of the same island written a little earlier
by one Jerosme Justinian<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. In the main the history is purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
fabulous, taking its start from a point, if my memory serves me
rightly, many centuries earlier than the Deluge; but the reference
to contemporary superstitions may I think be trusted.</p>

<p>Previously to the passage which I translate, the writer has
been telling the tale of the building of a wonderful tower by king
Scelerion of Chios, wherein to guard his daughter Omorfia (Beauty)
and three maids of honour with her until such time as he should
find a husband worthy of her; how the workmen never left the
tower till it was finished; how the master-mason threw down his
implements from the top and himself essayed to fly down on wings
of his own contrivance, which however failed to work as he had
hoped, with the result that he fell into the river below the castle
and was drowned; and how his ghost was seen there every first
of May at midday. This story, which may be taken as a fair
type of the whole ‘history,’ leads, by its mentions of apparitions
on May 1st, to the following passage<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘They have also another foolish belief, that near the tower are
to be seen three youthful women, clothed in white, who invite
passers-by to throw themselves into the river and get some cups
of gold and silver which by diabolical illusion are seen floating
on the water, in the hope that going into the river they may
be drowned in a whirlpool called by the Greeks Chiroclacas, the
water of which penetrates beneath the mountain as far as the
precipice where the princess still shows herself. Further, there
is no manner of doubt that the three ladies who appear to the
inhabitants of the place are those spirits who make their dwelling in
the water, assuming the form of women, and called by the ancients
<i>Nereides</i> or <i>Negiardes</i>; the good women are so abused by these
illusions that on the first of May they are wont to make crosses on
their doors, saying that the goddess of their mountains is due to
come and visit them in their houses, and that without this mark
she would not come in; likewise they say that she would slay
any one who should go to meet her. And so they give her the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
name of ‘good,’ being obliged by the fear in which they hold her
to give her this title of honour. Some people are of opinion that
this goddess is one of the Oread nymphs who dwell in the
mountains....’</p>

<p>This ‘goddess of the mountains’ whom they call ‘good’ (i.e.
probably <span class="greek">καλή</span>) is beyond doubt the same who was known to
Psellus and to Allatius as <span class="greek">ἡ καλὴ τῶν ὀρέων</span>, ‘the beautiful lady of
the mountains,’ and to my pastoral informant as <span class="greek">ἡ βασίλισσα τῶν
βουνῶν</span>, ‘the queen of the mountains’; and in general the conception
of her is the same as continues locally to the present day.
One statement indeed I cannot explain, namely that the women
make crosses on their doors with the purpose of attracting the
goddess to their houses; for I have already mentioned the same
use of the symbol for the contrary purpose of keeping the Nereids
out<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. Possibly as regards this detail of the ‘foolish belief’ the
<i>grand seigneur</i> was wrongly informed. But in other respects, in
the close association of the goddess with the Oreads or other
nymphs, in the fear which she inspired, in the belief that she
slew those who ventured upon her path, the Chian record is in
complete agreement with the description which I have given from
oral sources. In terror, as in charm, the Nereids’ queen is
foremost.</p>

<p>A contrary view however is taken by Bernard Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>, who
states that she is pictured by the commonfolk as gentler and
friendlier to man than her companions, and even disposed to check
their light and froward ways. On such a point, I freely admit,
local tradition might well vary; but in this particular case I am
inclined to think that Schmidt fell into the error of confusing
the wild-roaming, nymph-escorted goddess of hill and vale and
fountain with that other goddess who dwells solitary in the heart
of the mountain, dispensing blessings to the good and pains to
the wicked, and in the conception of whom we found an aftermath
of the ancient crop of legends concerning Demeter and Kore.
Surely this grand and lonely figure, ‘the Mistress of the Earth and
of the Sea,’ is in every trait different from the lovely, capricious,
cruel ‘Queen of the Mountains.’ Indeed the very circumstance
of both presentations being known in one and the same district&mdash;as,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
to my own knowledge, in Aetolia, and, on Schmidt’s own
showing, in Zacynthos<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>&mdash;proves that two divine persons, in
type and in character essentially different, are here involved,
and not merely two accidental and local differentiations of the
same deity. Doubtless in the more ‘civilised’ parts of Greece
(to use the word beloved of the half-educated town-bred
Greek), in the parts where old beliefs and customs are falling
into decay and contempt while nothing good is substituted for
them, even the lower classes have lost or are losing count and
memory of many of those powers whom their forefathers acknowledged;
but in the more favourably sequestered villages, let us
say, of Aetolia, where superstition still fears no mockery, no
peasant would commit the mistake of confounding his Demeter
with his Artemis. Between majestic loneliness and frolicsome
throng, between dignified beauty and bewitching loveliness,
between gentleness and lightness, between love of good and
wanton merriment, between justice and caprice, the gulf is wide.</p>

<p>But while the modern Artemis is the leader of her nymphs
in mischief and even in cruelty, it must not be thought that she
is always a foe to man. In Aetolia ‘the lady Beautiful’ is quick
to avenge a slight or an intrusion; but for those who pay her due
reverence she is a ready helper and a giver of good gifts. Health
and wealth lie in her hand, to bestow or to withhold, as in the
hands of the Nereids. Hence even he whom her sudden anger
has once smitten may regain her favour by offerings of honey and
other sweetmeats on the scene of his calamity. And probably
peace-offerings with less definite intent have been or still are in
vogue; for it is reported that presents used to be brought to the
cross-roads in Zacynthos at midday or midnight simply to appease
‘the great lady’ and her train<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>, a survival surely of the ancient
banquets of Hecate surnamed <span class="greek">Τριοδῖτις</span>, ‘Goddess of the Cross-roads.’</p>

<p>In some cases hesitation may be felt in pronouncing an opinion
whether it is for Artemis and the nymphs or for the Fates<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
(<span class="greek">Μοῖραι</span>) that these gifts are intended; and in the category of
the doubtful must be included all those cases where the dedi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>cation
of the offerings is merely to the <span class="greek">καλαὶς κυρᾶδες</span><a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>, ‘good
ladies,’ no further information being vouchsafed. Several writers,
including the German Ross and the Greek Pittakis, appear to
have assumed without sufficient enquiry that none but the
Nereids could be thus designated; but as a matter of fact, the
same euphemistic title is occasionally given also to the Fates<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>;
and while I incline to trust the experience and judgement of
Ross in the general statement which he makes concerning such
offerings at Athens, Thebes, and elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>, the accuracy of
Pittakis<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> on the other hand is challenged by the actual spot
which he is describing when he identifies the ‘good ladies’ with
the Nereids; for the place was none other than the so-called
‘prison of Socrates,’ which the testimony of many travellers
concurs in assigning to the Fates.</p>

<p>But, though some of the evidence concerning offerings demands
closer scrutiny before it can have any bearing upon the continued
belief in the existence of Artemis, there are certainly some corners
of Greece in which that goddess is still worshipped. ‘The great
lady,’ ‘the Queen of the mountains,’ ‘the lady Beautiful’ are the
various titles of a single goddess whose beauty and quick anger
have ever since the heroic age held the Greek folk in awe and
demanded their reverence; and until the inroads of European
civilisation destroy with the weapon of ridicule all that is old in
custom and creed, Artemis will continue to hold some sway over
hill and stream and woodland.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other queen, of whom my boatman spoke, ‘the Queen of
the Shore,’ she who stands in the shallows and by her beauty and
sweet voice entices the unwary to share her bed in the depths of
the sea, must I think be identified with a being who is more
commonly called ‘the Lamia of the Sea’ or ‘the Lamia of the
Shore.’ A popular poem<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> from Salonica, in which these two titles
are found side by side, tells of a contest between her and a young
shepherd. One day, in disregard of his mother’s warning, he was
playing his pipes upon the shore, when the Lamia appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
him and made a wager with him that she would dance longer
than he would go on playing. If he should win, he should have
her to wife; if she should win, she was to take all his flocks as
the prize. Three days the shepherd played, three whole nights
and days; then his strength failed him, and the Lamia took his
sheep and goats and left him destitute.</p>

<p>This poem has some points in common with a belief said to be
held in the district of Parnassos, that if a young man&mdash;especially
one who is handsome&mdash;play the flute or sing at mid-day or midnight
upon the shore, the Lamia thereof emerges from the depths of
the sea, and with promises of a happy life tries to persuade him
to be her husband and to come with her into the sea; if the
young man refuse, she slays him<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>; and presumably, though this is
not mentioned, if he consent, she drowns him.</p>

<p>The same Lamia, it is recorded<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>, is also known on the coasts of
Elis as a dangerous foe to sailors; for her work is the waterspout
and the whirlwind, whereby their ships are engulfed. Among the
Cyclades too the same belief certainly prevails (though I have
never obtained there any details concerning the character of the
Lamia); for on seeing a waterspout the sailors will exclaim, ‘the
Lamia of the Sea is passing’ (<span class="greek">περνάει ἡ Λάμια τοῦ πελάγου</span>),
and sometimes stick a black-handled knife into the mast as a
charm against her<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>.</p>

<p>In these somewhat meagre accounts of the Lamia of the Sea,
there are several points in harmony with the general conception
of Nereids. She is beautiful; she seeks the love of young men,
even though that love mean death to them; she is sweet of voice
and untiring in dance; and she passes to and fro in waterspout or
whirlwind. It is not surprising then to find that in Elis she is
actually named queen of the Nereids<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>, that is, without doubt, of
the sea-nymphs only, since she herself has her domain only in
the sea. And the title ‘queen of the shore’ which I learnt of my
boatman from Scyros points to the same belief; for as we found
Artemis, ‘queen of the mountains,’ to be the leader of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Nereids of the land, so should ‘the queen of the shore’ be ruler
over the Nereids of the sea.</p>

<p>How far this conception of the Lamia of the Sea accords with
classical tradition, it is impossible to decide. Only in one passage,
a fragment of Stesichorus<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>, is there any evidence of the connexion
of a Lamia with the sea. There the marine monster, Scylla, was
made ‘the daughter of Lamia,’ a phrase which has given rise to
the conjecture that the ancients like the moderns, as we shall see
in the next section, recognised more than one species. A marine
Lamia would supply the most natural parentage for Scylla; and
if her mother may be identified with the modern Lamia of the
Sea, the foe of ships and creator of the waterspout, the character
of Scylla is true to her lineage.</p>

<p>But the other traits in the character of the modern Lamia of
the Sea can hardly be hers by such ancient prescription. It is
difficult to suppose that Stesichorus pictured Scylla’s mother as a
thing of beauty; and the charm of the modern Lamia’s love-songs
which seduce men to their death is perhaps an attribute borrowed
from the Sirens. It is therefore in virtue of acquired rather than
original qualities that the Lamia of the Sea has come to be queen
of the sea-nymphs.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 11. <span class="smcap">Lamiae, Gelloudes, and Striges.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The three classes of female monsters, of whom the present
section treats, have ever since the early middle ages<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> been constantly
confounded, and the special attributes of each assigned
promiscuously to the others. This is due to the fact that all three
possess one pronounced quality in common, the propensity towards
preying upon young children; and wherever this horrible trait
has absorbed, as it well may, the whole attention of mediaeval
writer or modern peasant, the distinctions between them in origin
and nature have become obscured. Yet sufficient information is
forthcoming, if used with discrimination, to enable some account
to be given of each class separately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>The Lamiae are hideous monsters, shaped as gigantic and
coarse-looking women for the most part, but, with strange deformities
of the lower limbs such as Aristophanes attributed to a
kindred being, the Empusa<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>. Their feet are dissimilar and may
be more than two in number; one is often of bronze, while
others resemble those of animals&mdash;ox, ass, or goat<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. Tradition
relates that one of these monsters was once shot by a peasant at
Koropíon, a village in Attica, and was found to measure three
fathoms in length; and her loathsome nature was attested by the
fact that, when her body was thrown out in a desert plain, no
grass would grow where her blood had dripped<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>. The chief characteristics
of the Lamiae, apart from their thirst for blood, are their
uncleanliness, their gluttony, and their stupidity. The details of
the first need not be named, but would still furnish a jest for
Aristophanes in his coarser mood as they did of old<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>. Their
gluttony is clearly proved by their unwieldy corpulence. Their
stupidity is best shown in their sorry management of their homes;
for even the Lamiae have their domestic duties, being mated usually,
according to the folk-tales<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>, with dragons (<span class="greek">δράκοι</span>), and making
their abode in caverns and desert places. They ply the broom so
poorly that ‘the Lamia’s sweeping’ (<span class="greek">τῆς Λάμιας τὰ σαρώματα</span>)
has become a proverb for untidiness<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>; they are so ignorant of
bread-making that they put their dough into a cold oven and
heap the fire on top of it<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>; they give their dogs hay to eat, and
bones to their horses<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. But they have at least the redeeming
virtue of sometimes showing gratitude to those who help them
out of the ill plight to which their ignorance has brought them<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>.</p>

<p>Their stupidity also is regarded by the Greeks as a cause of
honesty. Though they are often rich, as being the consorts of
dragons whose chief function it is to keep guard over hidden
treasure, they have not the wit to keep their wealth, but foolishly
keep their word instead. Athenian tradition tells of a very rich
Lamia (known by the name of <span class="greek">ἡ Μόρα</span>, perhaps better written
<span class="greek">Μώρα</span>, a proper name formed from <span class="greek">μωρός</span>, ‘foolish’), who used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
walk about at night, seizing and crushing men whom she met till
they roared like bulls. But if her victim kept his wits about him
and snatched her head-dress from her, she would, in order to get
it back, promise him both life and wealth, and keep her word<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.</p>

<p>Such aspects of the Lamiae however are by no means universally
acknowledged; nine peasants out of ten, I suspect, could give
no further information about their character than that they feed
on human flesh and choose above all new-born infants as their
prey. Hence comes the popular phrase (employed, it would appear,
in more than one district of Greece) in reference to children who
have died suddenly, <span class="greek">τὸ παιδὶ τὸ ἔπνιξε ἡ Λάμια</span><a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>, ‘the Child has
been strangled by the Lamia.’</p>

<p>But in general I think the ravages of Lamiae have ceased to
inspire much genuine fear in the peasants’ minds. One there
was, so I heard, near Kephalóvryso in Aetolia, whose dwelling-place,
a cave beside a torrent-bed, was to some extent dreaded and
avoided. But in most parts the Lamia only justifies the memory
of her existence by serving to provide adventures for the heroes
of folk-stories; by lending her name, along with Empusa and
Mormo (who still locally survive<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>), as a terror with which mothers
may intimidate naughty children, or by furnishing it as a ready
weapon of vituperation in the wordy warfare of women.</p>

<p>The word Lamia, which has survived unchanged in form down
to the present day save that the by-forms <span class="greek">Λάμνα, Λάμνια</span> and
<span class="greek">Λάμνισσα</span> are locally preferred, did not originally it would seem
indicate a species of monster but a single person. Lamia according
to classical tradition was the name of a queen of Libya who was
loved by Zeus, and thus excited the resentment of Hera, who
robbed her of all her children; whereupon the desolate queen
took up her abode in a grim and lonely cavern, and there changed
into a malicious and greedy monster, who in envy and despair stole
and killed the children of more fortunate mothers<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>.</p>

<p>But a plural of the word, indicating that the single monster
had been multiplied into a whole class, soon occurs. Philostratus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span><a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
in speaking of ‘the Empusae, which the common people call
Lamiae and Mormolykiae,’ says, ‘Now these desire indeed the
pleasures of love, but yet more do they desire human flesh, and
use the pleasures of love to decoy those on whom they will feast.’
A plural such as is here used might of course be merely a studied
expression of contempt for vulgar superstitions; but the latter part
of the quotation seems to give a fair summary of the character of
ancient Lamiae. This is illustrated by a gruesome story, narrated
by Apuleius<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>, of two Lamiae who, in vengeance for a slight of the
love proffered by one of them to a young man named Socrates,
tore out his heart one night before the eyes of his companion
Aristomenes.</p>

<p>Of these two main characteristics of the ancient Lamiae, the
one, lasciviousness, has come to be mainly imputed in modern
times to the Lamia of the Sea, the single deity who rules the
sea-nymphs; while the craving for human flesh is the most
marked feature of the terrestrial tribe of Lamiae. But the latter
certainly are the truest descendants of the ancient Lamia, and
occupy a place in popular belief such as she held of old; for few,
it would seem, stood then in any serious fear of the Lamia; the
testimony of several ancient writers<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> (the story of Apuleius
notwithstanding) proves that more than two thousand years ago
she had already fallen to the level of bogeys which frighten none
but children.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gelloudes.</span></h4>

<p>In my account of the Nereids properly so-called, reference was
made to certain beings known in the Cyclades as <span class="greek">ἀγιελοῦδες</span> or
<span class="greek">γιαλοῦδες</span> and reckoned by several writers<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> among the nymphs of
the sea. In this they certainly have the support of popular
etymology; for in Amorgos Theodore Bent<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> heard that ‘an evil
spirit lived close by, which now and again rises out of the sea and
seizes infants; hence it is called Gialoù (from <span class="greek">γιαλός</span><a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>, the sea
(<i>sic</i>)).’ But it is, I think, only an erroneous association by the
inhabitants of the Cyclades of two like-sounding words which has
caused the <span class="greek">Ἀγιελοῦδες</span> to be regarded as marine demons; Bent’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
information transposes cause and effect. Elsewhere in Greece
there are known certain beings called <span class="greek">Γελλοῦδες</span> or <span class="greek">Γιλλοῦδες</span>,
female demons with a propensity to carry off young children and
to devour them; and it is strange that so careful an authority on
Greek folk-lore as Bernhard Schmidt should not have recognised
that the name <span class="greek">ἀγιελοῦδες</span> employed in some of the Cyclades is
only a dialectic form of the commoner <span class="greek">γελλοῦδες</span><a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> with an
euphonetic <span class="greek">ἀ</span> prefixed as in the case of <span class="greek">νεράϊδες</span> and <span class="greek">ἀνεράϊδες</span>.
Enquiry in Tenos revealed to me the fact, not mentioned, though
perhaps implied, in the statement of Bent, that the <span class="greek">ἀγιελοῦδες</span> are
there believed to feed upon the children whom they carry off.
This trait at once confirms their identity with the <span class="greek">γελλοῦδες</span>, and
renders it impossible to class them as a form of nymph. It is of
course believed that nymphs of the sea or of rivers, when they
carry off human children to their watery habitations, do incidentally
drown them, but by an oversight and not of malice
prepense. But savagely to prey upon human flesh&mdash;for all the
nymphs’ wantonness and cruelty, that is a thing abhorrent from
their nature and inconceivable in them. This horrid propensity
proves the <span class="greek">γελλοῦδες</span> or <span class="greek">ἀγιελοῦδες</span> to be a separate class of
female demons.</p>

<p>The chief authority on these malignant beings is Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>,
who both quotes a series of passages which enable us to trace the
development of the belief in them, and also tells a story which is
the only source of evidence concerning other of their characteristics
than their appetite for the flesh of infants.</p>

<p>Their prototype, mentioned, we are told, by Sappho, was the
maiden Gello, whose spectre after her untimely end was said by
the people of Lesbos to beset children and to be chargeable with
the early deaths of infants<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>.</p>

<p>The individuality of this Gello continued to be recognised to
some extent as late as the tenth century<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>; for Ignatius, a deacon
of Constantinople, in his life of the Patriarch Tarasius named
her as a single demon, though he added that the crime of killing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
children in the same way was also imputed to a whole class of
witches. ‘Hence,’ comments Allatius, ‘it has come about that at
the present day Striges (i.e. the witches of whom Ignatius speaks),
because they practise evil arts upon infants and by sucking their
blood or in other ways cause their death, are called Gellones<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>.’
In the story also which exhibits the chief qualities of this demon,
her name (in the form <span class="greek">Γυλοῦ</span>) appears still as a proper name.</p>

<p>But the multiplication of the single demon into a whole class
dates from long before the time of Allatius. John of Damascus
in the eighth century used the plural <span class="greek">γελοῦδες</span> as a popular word,
the meaning of which he took to be the same as that of Striges
(<span class="greek">στρίγγαι</span>); and Michael Psellus too in the eleventh century
evidently regarded these two words as interchangeable designations
of a class of beings (whether of demons or of witches, he leaves
uncertain); for after an exact account of the Striges and their
thirst for children’s blood, he says that new-born infants who waste
away (as if from the draining of their blood by these Striges) are
called <span class="greek">Γιλλόβρωτα</span><a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>, ‘Gello-eaten.’</p>

<p>The story of Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>, which sets forth the chief qualities
of Gello, is a legend of which the Saints Sisynios and Synidoros
are the heroes. The children of their sister Melitene had been
devoured by this demon, and they set themselves to capture her.
She, to effect her escape, at once changed her shape, and became
first a swallow and then a fish; but, for all her slippery and elusive
transformations, they finally caught her in the form of a goat’s
hair adhering to the king’s beard. Then addressing to her the
words ‘Cease, foul Gello, from slaying the babes of Christians,’
they worked upon her fears until they extorted from her a confession
of her twelve and a half names, the knowledge of which
was a safeguard against her assaults.</p>

<p>It is this list of names in which the various aspects of her
activity appear. The first is <span class="greek">Γυλοῦ</span>, one of the forms of the
name Gello; the second <span class="greek">Μωρά</span><a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>, the name of a kind of Lamia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the third <span class="greek">Βυζοῦ</span> or ‘blood-sucker’; the fourth <span class="greek">Μαρμαροῦ</span>, probably
‘stony-hearted’; the fifth <span class="greek">Πετασία</span>, for she can fly as a bird in the
air; the sixth <span class="greek">Πελαγία</span>, for she can swim as a fish in the sea; the
seventh <span class="greek">Βορδόνα</span><a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>, probably meaning ‘stooping like a kite on her
prey’; the eighth <span class="greek">Ἀπλετοῦ</span>, ‘insatiable’; the ninth <span class="greek">Χαμοδράκαινα</span>,
for she can lurk like a snake in the earth; the tenth
<span class="greek">Ἀναβαρδαλαία</span><a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>, possibly ‘soaring like a lark in the air’; the
eleventh <span class="greek">Ψυχανασπάστρια</span><a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>, ‘snatcher of souls’; the twelfth
<span class="greek">Παιδοπνίκτρια</span>, ‘strangler of children’; and the half-name <span class="greek">Στρίγλα</span>,
the kind of witch whereof the next section treats.</p>

<p>Whether these names are anywhere still remembered as a
mystic incantation, or all the qualities which they imply still
imputed to the Gelloudes, I cannot say. But a modern cure for
such of the demon’s injuries as are not immediately fatal has been
recorded from Amorgos. ‘If a child has been afflicted by it, the
mother first sends for the priest to curse the demon, and scratches
her child with her nails; if these plans do not succeed, she has to
go down at sunset to the shore, and select forty round stones
brought up by forty different waves; these she must take home
and boil in vinegar, and when the cock crows the evil phantom
will disappear and leave the child whole<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.’</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Striges.</span></h4>

<p>The Striges, though often confused with Lamiae and with
Gelloudes, are essentially different from them. The two classes
with which I have dealt are demons; the Striges, in the modern
acceptation of the term, are women who possess the power to
transform themselves into birds of prey or other animals; and it
is only the taste for blood, shared by them with those demons,
which has created the confusion.</p>

<p>The Striges moreover cannot, like the Lamiae or Gelloudes,
be claimed either as an original product of the Greek imagination
or as the exclusive property of Greek superstition at the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
day. The Albanians have a word <span class="greek">σ̈τρῑ́γ̇ε̱α</span>, and the people of
Corsica a term <i>strega</i>, both of which denote a witch of the same
powers and propensities as are feared in Greece; and it is likely
that all of them&mdash;Greeks, Albanians, Corsicans&mdash;have borrowed
the conception from Italy. The ancient Greeks indeed had a
word <span class="greek">στρίγξ</span> identical with the <i>strix</i> of Latin, but the shrieking
night-bird denoted by it was not, so far as I can discover, invested
by Greek imagination with any terrors. In Italy on the contrary
the Strix was widely feared as a bloodthirsty monster in bird-form.
Pliny evidently supposed it to be some actual bird, though he
doubted the fables concerning it. ‘The <i>strix</i>,’ he says, ‘certainly
is mentioned in ancient curses; but what kind of bird it may be,
is not I think agreed<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>.’ Perhaps in those ‘ancient curses’ it was
invoked to inflict such punishment upon enemies as it once meted
out to Otos and Ephialtes for their attempt upon Diana’s chastity<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>.</p>

<p>The notion however that Striges were not really birds but
witches in bird-form early suggested itself and found an exponent
in Ovid<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>. ‘Voracious birds,’ he says, ‘there are ... that fly forth by
night and assail children who still need a nurse’s care, and seize
them out of their cradles and do them mischief. With their
beaks they are said to pick out the child’s milk-fed bowels, and
their throat is full of the blood they drink. Striges they are
called ... and whether they come into being as birds or are changed
thereto by incantation, and the Marsian spell transforms old women
into winged things,’&mdash;such are their ways.</p>

<p>This was probably the state of the superstition when the
Greeks added Striges to their own list of nightly terrors; and the
very form of the word in modern Greek, <span class="greek">στρίγλα</span> or <span class="greek">στρίγγλα</span>
(being apparently a diminutive, <i>strigula</i>, such as spoken Latin
would readily have formed from the literary form <i>strix</i>), testifies
to the borrowing of the belief.</p>

<p>In Greece the latter of the two ways in which Ovid explained
the origin of the Strix seems to have been generally accepted as
correct. It is true that the modern Greeks still have a real bird
called <span class="greek">στριγλοποῦλι</span><a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> (either some kind of owl or the night-jar),
which not only loves twilight or darkness in the upper world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
but is also said to haunt the gloomy demesnes of Charos below&mdash;thereby
revealing perhaps some slight evidence of its relationship
to the <i>strix</i> which tormented the brother giants; but the Strigla
has long ceased to be a real bird, and (apart from the confusion
with a Lamia or Gello) is always a witch.</p>

<p>The condition of the belief in the eighth century is noticed by
John of Damascus<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>. ‘There are some of the more ignorant who
say that there are women known as Striges (<span class="greek">Στρῦγγαι</span>), otherwise
called Geloudes. They allege that these are to be seen at night
passing through the air, and that when they happen to come to a
house they find no obstacle in doors and bolts, but though the
doors are securely locked make their way in and throttle infants.
Others say that the Strix devours the liver and all the internal
organs of the children, and so sets a short limit to their lives.
And they stoutly declare, some that they have seen, and others
that they have heard, the Strix entering houses, though the doors
were locked, either in bodily form or as a spirit only.’</p>

<p>Again in the eleventh century Michael Psellus noticed the same
superstition, though as we have seen his language suggests some
confusion of Striges with Gelloudes. But he is really describing
the faculty of the former to assume the shape of birds when he
says, ‘The superstition obtaining nowadays invests old women
with this power. It provides them with wings in their extreme
age, and represents them as settling<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> unseen upon infants, whom,
it is alleged, they suck until they exhaust all the humours in
them’<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

<p>Leo Allatius, by whom this passage is cited, produces both
from his own experience and from the testimony of others several
instances of such occurrences, and mentions also the various
precautions taken against them. These include all-night watches,
lamps suspended before the pictures of patron-saints, amulets of
garlic or of coral, and the smearing of oil from some saint’s lamp
on the face of the child or invalid. It will suffice however to
quote his general description of the Striges according to the
beliefs of the seventeenth century. Striges (<span class="greek">στρίγλαις</span>), he tells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
us in effect, are old women whom poverty and misery drive to
contract an alliance with the devil for all evil purposes; men are
little molested by them, but women and still more commonly
children, being a weaker and easier prey, suffer much from them,
their breath alone<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> being so pernicious as to cause insanity or
even death. They are especially addicted to attacking new-born
babes, sucking out their blood and leaving them dead, or so
polluting them by their touch that what life remains to them is
never free from sickness.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed in this last account of the Striges,
that the range of their activity is somewhat enlarged, so that
women as well as children fall victims to them. At the present
day, though they are believed to prey chiefly upon infants, even
grown men are not immune, as witness a story<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> from Messenia.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a man was passing the night at the house of
a friend whose household consisted of his wife and mother-in-law.
About midnight some noise awakened him, and listening intently
he made out the voices of the two women conversing together. What
he heard terrified him, for they were planning to eat himself or his
host, whichever proved the fatter. At once he perceived that his
friend’s wife and mother-in-law were Striges, and knowing that there
was no other means of escaping the danger that was threatening
him, he determined to try to save himself by guile. The Striges
advanced towards the sleeping men and took hold of their guest’s
foot to see if it was heavy, and consequently fat and good for
eating; he however, understanding their purpose, raised his foot
of his own accord as they took it in their hands and weighed it,
so that it felt to them as light as a feather, and they let it drop
again disappointed. Then they took hold of the foot of the
other man who was sleeping, and naturally found it very heavy.
Delighted at the result of their investigation, they ripped open
the wretched man’s breast, pulled out his liver and other parts,
and threw them among the hot ashes on the hearth to cook.
Then noticing that they had no wine, they flew to the wine-shop,
took what they wanted and returned. But in the interval the
guest got up, collected the flesh that was being cooked, stowed it
away in his pouch, and put in its place on the hearth some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
animal’s dung. The Striges however ate up greedily what was on
the hearth, complaining only that it was somewhat over-done.
The next day the two friends rose and left the house; the victim
of the previous night was very pale, but he did not bear the
slightest wound or scar on his breast. He remarked to his companion
that he felt excessively hungry, and the other gave him
what had been cooked during the night, which he ate and found
exceedingly invigorating; the blood mounted to his cheeks and
he was perfectly sound again. Thereupon his friend told him
what had happened during the night, and they went together and
slew the Striges.</p>

<p>This story exhibits all the essential qualities of Striges. The
pair of them are women, and one at least, the mother-in-law, is
old; they choose the night for their depredations; they can
assume the form of birds, for ‘they flew,’ it is said, to the wine-shop;
and their taste for human flesh is the <i>motif</i> of the story.</p>

<p>It must however be acknowledged that as the area of the
Striges’ activities has become somewhat extended, so also has the
ancient limitation of the term to old women become locally somewhat
relaxed. In many parts of Greece a belief is held that
certain infants are liable to a form of lycanthropy; and female
infants so disposed are sometimes called Striges. A story from
Tenos<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>, narrated in several versions, concerns an infant princess
who was a Strigla. Every day one of the king’s horses was found
to have been killed and devoured in the night. The three
princes, her brothers, therefore kept watch in turn; and it fell to
the fortune of the youngest of them, owing to his courage and
skill, to detect the malefactor. About midnight he heard a noise,
and fired into the middle of a cloud that seemed to hang over the
horses, thereby so wounding his sister that the mark observed on
her next day betrayed her nightly doings. Not daring however
to accuse her to his father, he fled from home with his mother to
a place of safety, while the girl remained undisturbed in her
voracity and consumed one by one all the people of the town.</p>

<p>But in other places where the same belief prevails, as we
shall see later, these <i>enfants terribles</i>, who may be of either sex,
are called not Striges but by some such name as ‘callicantzaros,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
‘vrykolakas,’ or ‘gorgon’; and this variety of names is in itself a
proof that, while the idea of infant cannibals is widespread, no
exact verbal equivalent now exists, and each of the several names
used is only requisitioned to supply the deficiency. A child can
indeed enjoy the title of Strigla by courtesy; only an old woman
can possess it of right.</p>

<p>Thus the old Graeco-Roman fear of Striges still remains little
changed. The Church has repeatedly forbidden belief in them<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>;
legislation has prohibited in times past the killing of them<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>.
But the link of superstition between the past and the present is
still unbroken; and witch-burning is an idea which in any secluded
corner of Greece might still be put into effect<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 12. <span class="smcap">Gorgons.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The modern conception of the Gorgon (<span class="greek">ἡ γοργόνα</span>) or Gorgons
(<span class="greek">γοργόνες</span>)&mdash;for popular belief seems to vary locally between
recognising one or more such beings&mdash;is extremely complex. Of
my own knowledge I can unfortunately contribute nothing new to
what has been published by others concerning them; for though
I have several times heard Gorgons mentioned, and always on
further enquiry found them to be terrible demons who dwell in
the sea, it has so chanced that I have been unable to get any
more explicit information on the subject. The present section is
therefore, so far as the facts are concerned, a compilation from
the researches of others, especially of Prof. Polites of Athens
University.</p>

<p>A Gorgon is represented as half woman, half fish. Rough
sketches on the walls of small taverns and elsewhere may
often be observed, depicting a woman with the tail of a fish,
half emerging from the waves, and holding in one hand a ship,
in the other an anchor; sometimes also she is armed with a
breastplate<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. Similar designs are also to be seen tattooed upon
the arms or breasts of men of the lower classes, especially among
the maritime population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p>The Gorgons themselves are to be encountered in all parts of
the sea; but their favourite resort, especially on Saturday nights,
is reputed to be the Black Sea, where if one of them meets a
ship, grasping the bows with her hand she asks, ‘Is king
Alexander living?’ To this the sailors must reply ‘he lives and
reigns,’ and may add ‘and he keeps the world at peace,’ or ‘and
long life to you too!’; for then the awful and monstrous Gorgon in
gladness at the tidings transforms herself into a beautiful maiden
and calms the waves and sings melodiously to her lyre. If on the
contrary the sailors make the mistake of saying that Alexander
is dead, she either capsizes the ship with her own hand or by the
wildness of her lamentations raises a storm from which there is
no escape nor shelter<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>. The mention of Alexander the Great in
these stories of the Gorgons, as also sometimes in connexion with
the Nereids, is unimportant; it is not an instance of purely oral
tradition, but has its source in the history of Alexander by
Pseudocallisthenes<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>, of which there exist paraphrases in the
popular tongue. The interest of such fables lies in the association
of beauty and melody as well as of horror with the Gorgons, and
in the <i>rôle</i> of marine deity which they play.</p>

<p>In general however it is upon the monstrous and terrifying
aspect of the Gorgons that the common-folk seize, so that the
name Gorgon is metaphorically applied to ill-favoured and malevolent
women<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. Thus in Rhodes it is used of any large fierce-looking
virago<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>; in Cephalonia (where also the word <span class="greek">Μέδουσα</span>, Medusa,
survives in the same sense) of any lady conspicuously ill-featured<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>.
Allusion too has already been made to the case where a child
possessed by a mania of bloodthirstiness is occasionally called a
Gorgon<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>.</p>

<p>But there is another and fresh aspect of the Gorgon’s nature
suggested by the use of the word in Cythnos. There it is metaphorically
applied to depraved women<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>; and this isolated usage is
in accord with one description of the Gorgon which has come
down from the middle ages. This description forms part of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
poem entitled ‘The Physiologus<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>’ (written in the most debased
ecclesiastical Greek and supposed to date from before the
thirteenth century), which gives a fantastic account of the habits
of many birds and beasts among which the Gorgon is included.</p>

<p>‘The Gorgon is a beast like unto a harlot; the hair of her head
is all auburn; the ends thereof are as it were heads of snakes;
and her body is bare and smooth, white as a dove, and her bosom
is a woman’s with breasts fair to behold; but the look of her face
brings death; whatsoever looks upon her falls down and dies.
She dwells in the regions of the West. She knows all languages
and the speech of wild beasts. When she desires a mate, she
calls first to the lion; for fear of death he draws not near to her.
Again she calls the dragon, but neither does he go; and even so
all the beasts both small and great. She pipes sweetly and sings
with charm beyond all; lastly she utters human voice: “Come,
sate fleshly desire, ye men, of my beauty, and I of yours.” The
men, knowing then their opportunity against her, lay snares that
she may lose her pleasure; and stand afar off, that they may not see
her, and raise their voice and cry and say unto her: “Dig a deep
pit and put thy head therein, that we may not die and may come
with thee.” She straightway then goes and makes a great hole
and puts her head therein and leaves her body; from the waist
downward it is seen naked; so she remains and awaits the pains
of lewdness. The man goes from behind, cuts off her head, holds
it face downward, and places it in a vessel, and if he meet dragon
or lion or leopard, he shows the head, and the beasts die.’</p>

<p>These modern or mediaeval descriptions of the Gorgons,
though they are by no means consistent one with another, offer
four main aspects in which the modern Gorgon may be compared
with the creatures of ancient mythology. Her face is terrible
either in its surpassing loveliness or in its overwhelming hideousness.
She possesses the gift of entrancing melody. She is voluptuous.
She dwells in the sea.</p>

<p>The first aspect may be derived directly from the ancient
conception of the Gorgons. The word <span class="greek">Γοργώ</span> itself is a name
formed from the adjective <span class="greek">γοργός</span> and means simply ‘fierce’ or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
‘terrible’ in look, without implying anything of beauty or the
opposite; while of Medusa, the Gorgon <i>par excellence</i>, tradition
relates that once she was a beautiful maiden beloved of Poseidon,
and that it was only through the wrath of Athena that her hair
was changed into writhing snakes and her loveliness lost in horror.
Moreover in ancient works of art the representation of the
Gorgon’s head varies from a type of cruel beauty to a grinning
mask. But it is also possible that the idea of their beauty is due
to a confusion of Gorgons with Sirens, from whom, as we shall see,
certain traits have certainly been borrowed.</p>

<p>These traits are the two next aspects of the modern Gorgons
which we have to consider, the sweetness of their singing and
their voluptuousness. These were the essential qualities of the
Sirens, and have undoubtedly been transferred to the Gorgons no
less than to the Lamia of the Sea<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>Possibly also from the same source comes the mixed shape,
half woman and half fish, in which the Gorgon is now pourtrayed.
The Sirens were indeed originally terrestrial, dwelling in a meadow
near the sea, yet not venturing in the deep themselves, but luring
men to shipwreck on the coast by the spell of their song; and an
echo perhaps of this conception, though the Sirens themselves
are no longer known, lives on in a folk-song which pictures the
enchantment of a maiden’s love-song wafted to seafarers’ ears
from off the shore: ‘Thereby a ship was passing with sails outspread.
Sailors that hearken to that voice and look upon such
beauty, forget their sails and forsake their oars; they cannot
voyage any more; they know not how to set sail<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>.’ But by the
sixth century<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> the traditional habitat of the Sirens had changed.
‘The Sirens,’ says an anonymous work on monsters and great
beasts, ‘are mermaids, who by their exceeding beauty and winning
song ensnare mariners; from the head to the navel they are of
human and maidenly form, but they have the scaly tails of
fishes<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>.’ This description establishes an unquestionable connexion
between the Sirens and the modern Gorgons.</p>

<p>But the fourth aspect of the Gorgons on which I have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
touch, their connexion with the sea, is not, I think, to be explained
as another loan from the Sirens. On the contrary the Gorgons
were it would seem deities of the sea, when the Sirens were still
dwellers upon the shore; and it was their originally marine
character which enabled them to absorb the qualities once
attributed to the Sirens. Thus according to Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> the three
Gorgons were daughters of the sea-deities Phorcys and Ceto, and
their home was at the western bound of Ocean. Further one of
their number, Medusa, was loved by the sea-god Poseidon, and
gave birth both to the horse Pegasus whose name may be a
derivative of <span class="greek">πήγη</span>, ‘water-spring,’ and whose resort was certainly
the fountain of Pirene<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>, and also to Chrysaor whose bride was
‘Callirrhoe, daughter of far-famed Ocean.’ Whether this mythological
problem is capable of solution in terms of natural phenomena<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
does not here concern us; but it is a straightforward and necessary
inference from these genealogical data, that an early and intimate
connexion existed between the Gorgons and the sea. And here
art comes to the support of literature. In the National Museum
of Athens are two vases of about the sixth century, depicting
Gorgons in the company of dolphins. The first, an early Attic
<i>amphora</i><a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> represents the three Gorgons, of whom Medusa appears
headless, surrounded by a considerable number of them. The
second, a <i>kylex</i><a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> with offset lip of the <i>Kleinmeister</i> type, pourtrays
a single Gorgon with a dolphin on either side. These artistic
presentments furnish the strongest possible corroboration of
Hesiodic lore, and justify the assertion that from the earliest
times the Gorgons were deities of the sea. It was clearly then in
virtue of their own marine character that they were able later to
usurp also the place of the Sirens.</p>

<p>But the Sirens are not the only ancient beings who have contributed
to the formation of the popular conception of modern
Gorgons. In one story<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> the personality of Scylla is unmistakeable
beneath the disguise of name. This fusion is the more natural
in that Scylla was from the beginning<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> a monster of the sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
whose form, according to Vergil<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>, terminated like that of latter-day
Gorgons in a fish’s tail; a monster too fully as terrible in
her own way as any Gorgon. The following extract from the
story contains all that is pertinent.</p>

<p>‘So the lad departed and tramped on for twenty hours. Then
he came to a village by the sea, and saw some men busy lading
a boat with oil, and they were carrying on board each one a
barrel. When he drew near to them, he said, “Can you carry
but one barrel at a time, my good fellows? See how many I will
carry.” So saying, he took a barrel on each shoulder, and placed
them in the boat. Then said the captain to him, “Thank you, my
lad” (for he was afraid of him), “come and have some food.” “No,
thank you, captain,” he replied, “I do not want any. But when
you are passing yonder straits, please take me along with you.”
The captain was delighted to do so, for in the sea at that place
there was a Gorgon, and from every boat that passed she took one
man as toll and devoured him, or else swamped the whole boat.
So they set out, and as they were going the captain said to the
lad, “Take a turn at the tiller, my boy, that we may go and sleep,
for we are tired.” Accordingly they went below&mdash;to sleep, so they
pretended&mdash;and the lad remained at the helm. Suddenly the
boat stopped. He was looking about on each side when he heard
a voice behind him. He turned at once and saw a beautiful
woman with golden hair, who said to him, “Give me my tribute.”
“What tribute?” replied the lad. “The man whom I devour from
each boat that passes.” “Give me your hand,” said the lad to her.
Straightway without demur she gave it to him, and tried to pull
him down into the sea. At this the lad grew angry. “Come up,
you she-devil, come up here,” he cried, and dashed her upon
the deck. Then he belaboured her soundly, and said to her:
“Swear to me that you will never molest man again, or I will not
let you go.” “I swear,” she said, “by my mother the sea and by my
father Alexander, that I will molest none.” Then he threw her
back into the sea.’</p>

<p>Apart from the description of the Gorgon in this story, as in
others, as a ‘beautiful woman with golden hair,’ the tradition
which has contributed chiefly to the invention of the episode is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
the ancient myth of Scylla and, we may perhaps add, of
Charybdis; for here too the straits are the scene of alternative
horrors, either the devouring of one man out of the crew or the
sinking of the whole craft.</p>

<p>But in spite of the fusion of both Scylla and the Sirens with
the Gorgons in the crucible of popular imagination, analysis of
the complex modern conception still reveals two elements in the
Gorgons’ nature which vindicate their claim to their ancient
name, their association with the sea and the terror that they
inspire.</p>

<p>The Callicántzari (<span class="greek">Καλλικάντζαροι</span>) are the most monstrous
of all the creatures of the popular imagination, and none are
better known to the Greek-speaking world at large; for even
where educated men have ceased to believe in them, they still
figure in the stories told and retold to children with each recurring
New Year’s Day; and, among the peasants, many reach
manhood or womanhood without outgrowing their early fears of
them.</p>

<p>The name Callicantzaros itself appears in many dialectic and
widely differing forms, and there are also a multitude of local
by-names. Of the former I shall treat later in discussing the
origin of the word Callicantzaros, while the by-names, being for the
most part descriptive of the appearance or qualities of these
monsters, will be mentioned as occasion requires. But even where
other local names are in common use, some form of the word
Callicantzaros is almost always employed as well, or at least is
understood.</p>

<p>As in the nomenclature, so too in the description of the
Callicantzari, one locality differs very widely from another. And
this cannot be merely a result of the wide distribution of the
belief in them; for the Nereids certainly are equally widely known,
and yet their appearance and habits are, broadly speaking, everywhere
the same. The extraordinary divergences and even
contradictions in different accounts of the Callicantzari demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
some other explanation than that of casual variation. That
explanation, as I shall show later, lies in their identity with the
ancient Centaurs. But before I discuss their origin, I must
attempt as general a description of their appearance and habits
as the vast variation of local traditions permits. In revising this
description I have had the advantage of consulting Prof. Polites’
new work on the traditions of modern Greece<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>, from which I have
learnt some new facts, and have obtained on several points
confirmation from a new source of what I had myself heard or
surmised. I take this opportunity of gratefully acknowledging
my indebtedness to him.</p>

<p>In describing the Callicantzari, although the diversities of
their outward form are almost endless, two main classes of them
must be distinguished, because corresponding with that physical
division there is also a marked difference in character. The two
classes differ physically in stature, and, while all Callicantzari are
essentially mischievous in character, the mischief wrought by the
larger sort is often of a malicious and even deadly order, while
the smaller sort are more frolicsome and harmless in their
tricks.</p>

<p>The larger kind vary from the size of a man to that of a
gigantic monster whose loins are on a level with the chimneypots.
They are usually black in colour, and covered with a coat
of shaggy hair, but a bald variety is also sometimes mentioned.
Their heads and also their sexual organs are out of all proportion
to the rest of their bodies. Their faces are black; their eyes
glare red; they have the ears of goats or asses; from their huge
mouths blood-red tongues loll out, flanked by ferocious tusks.
Their bodies are in general very lean, so that in some districts the
word Callicantzaros is applied metaphorically to a very lean man<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>;
but a shorter and thickset variety also occurs. They have the arms
and hands of monkeys, and their nails are as long again as their
fingers and curved like the talons of a vulture. They are sometimes
furnished with long thin tails. They have the legs of a goat or an
ass, or sometimes one human leg and one of bestial form; or again
both legs are of human shape, but the foot so distorted that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
toes come where the heel should be<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. Hence it is not surprising
that they are often lame, but even so they are swift of foot and
terrible in strength. ‘They devour their road at the pace of
Pegasus,’ wrote Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>; and at the present day several
by-names bear witness to their speed. In Samos they are called
<span class="greek">Καλλισπούδηδες</span><a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>, ‘those who make good speed’; in Cyprus
<span class="greek">Πλανήταροι</span><a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>, ‘the wanderers’; in Athens they have the humorous
title <span class="greek">Κωλοβελόνηδες</span>, formed from the proverbial expression
<span class="greek">βελόνια ἔχει ’στὸν κῶλο του</span>, ‘he has needles in his buttocks,’
said of any one who cannot sit still, but is always on the move<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>.
Their strength also has earned them one by-name, reported from
Kardamýle in Maina, <span class="greek">τὰ τσιλικρωτά</span>, said to be formed from the
Turkish <i>tselik</i> (‘iron’), in the sense of ‘strong as iron<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>.’</p>

<p>All or any of the features which I have mentioned may be
found in the person of a single Callicantzaros; but it must
be allowed also that no one of them is essential. For sometimes
the Callicantzaros appears in ordinary human form without so
much as a cloven hoof to distinguish him from ordinary mankind,
or again completely in animal shape. In one place they are
described as <span class="greek">ἀγριάνθρωποι</span><a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>, savages but human in appearance,
while in another they are <span class="greek">ἄγρια τετράποδα</span><a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>, ‘savage quadrupeds.’</p>

<p>Yet in general the Callicantzari are neither wholly anthropomorphic
nor wholly theriomorphic, but a blend of the two. In
a story of some men at Athens who dressed themselves up as
Callicantzari, it is said that they blacked their faces and covered
themselves with feathers<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>. Again two grotesque and bestial clay
statuettes from the Cabirium near Thebes and now in the National
Museum at Athens, were identified by peasants as Callicantzari<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>;
an identification I have also met with when questioning peasants
about similar objects in local museums; in one case it was a
Satyr and in another a Centaur which my guide identified as a
Callicantzaros. On the whole I should say that the goat con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>tributes
more than any other animal to the popular conception
of these monsters. Besides having the legs and the ears of goats,
as was noted above, they are sometimes said to have their horns
also; and in Chios their resemblance to goats is so clearly recognised
that in one village they have earned the by-name of
<span class="greek">Κατσικᾶδες</span><a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>, which by formation should mean ‘men who have
to do with goats (<span class="greek">κατσίκια</span>),’ though it has apparently been
appropriated to the designation of beings who are in form half
goat and half man. There are however districts, as we shall
see later, in which some other animal than the goat forms the
predominant element in the monstrous <i>ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>The smaller sort of Callicantzari is rarer than the large, but
their distribution is at any rate wide. They are the predominant
type in north-west Arcadia, in the district about Mount Parnassus,
and at Oenoë<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> on the southern shore of the Black Sea. They are
most often human in shape, but are mere pigmies, no taller than
a child of five or six. They are usually black, like the larger sort,
but are smooth and hairless. They are very commonly deformed,
and in this respect the strange beasts on which they ride are like
them. At Arachova<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>, on the slopes of Parnassus, every one of
them is said to have some physical defect. Some are lame; others
squint; others have only one eye; others have their noses or
mouths, hands or feet set all askew; and as a cavalcade of them
passes by night through the village, one is to be seen mounted on
a cock and his long thin legs trail on the ground as he rides;
another has a horse no bigger than a small dog; another, the
tiniest of them all, is perched on an enormous donkey’s back, and
when he falls off cannot mount again; and others again ride
strange unknown beasts, lame, one-eyed, or one-eared like their
masters.</p>

<p>Callicantzari of this type are usually harmless to men. They
play indeed the same boisterous pranks as their larger brethren,
but perhaps owing to their insignificant size are an object of
merriment rather than of fear. But, as I shall show later, there
is reason to believe that they are not the original type of
Callicantzari. It is only by a casual development of the superstition,
that these grotesque hobgoblins have been locally sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>stituted
for the grim and gaunt monsters feared elsewhere. They
form, as it were, a modern and expurgated edition of the larger
sort of Callicantzari, to whom I now return.</p>

<p>The Callicantzari appear only during the <span class="greek">δωδεκαήμερον</span> or
‘period of twelve days’ between Christmas and Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. The
rest of the year they live in the lower world, and occupy themselves
in trying to gnaw through or cut down the great tree (or in
other accounts the one or more columns) on which the world rests.
Each Christmas they have nearly completed their task, when the
time comes for their appearance in the upper world, and during
their twelve days’ absence, the supports of the world are made
whole again.</p>

<p>Even during their short visit to this world, they do not appear
in the daytime. From dawn till sunset they hide themselves
in dark and dank places&mdash;in caves or beneath mills&mdash;and there
feed on such food as they can collect, worms, snakes, frogs, tortoises,
and other unclean things. But at night they issue forth and run
wildly to and fro, rending and crushing those who cross their
path. Destruction and waste, greed and lust mark their course.
Now they break into some lonely mill, terrify and coerce the
miller into showing them his store, bake for themselves cakes
thereof, befoul with urine all that they cannot use, and are gone
again. Now they pass through some hamlet, and woe to that
house which is not prepared against their coming. By chimney
and door alike they swarm in, and make havoc of the home; in
sheer wanton mischief they overturn and break all the furniture,
devour the Christmas pork, befoul all the water and wine and
food which remains, and leave the occupants half dead with fright
or violence. Now it is a wine shop that they enter, bind the
publican to his chair, gag him with dung, break open each cask in
turn, drink their fill, and leave the wine running. Now they light
upon some belated wayfarer, and make sport of him as their fancy
leads them. Sometimes his fate is only to dance all night with
the Callicantzari and to be let go at cockcrow unscathed; for
these monsters despite their uncouth shape delight in dancing,
and to that end often seek the company of the Nereids; but
more often men are sorely torn and battered before they escape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
and women are forcibly carried off to be the monsters’ wives.
In some accounts they even make a meal of their human prey.</p>

<p>The fact that the activities of the Callicantzari are always
limited to the night-time has given them a special claim to the
name <span class="greek">Παρωρίταις</span> or <span class="greek">Νυχτοπαρωρίταις</span><a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>, formed from <span class="greek">πάρωρα</span>,
‘the hour before cockcrow,’ for then it is that their excesses and
depredations have reached their zenith; but the word cannot
correctly be called a by-name of the Callicantzari, for it is also, if
more rarely, applied to other nocturnal visitants.</p>

<p>The only redeeming qualities in these creatures’ characters,
from the point of view of men who fall into their clutches, are
their stupidity and their quarrelsomeness. They have indeed
a chieftain who sometimes tries to marshal and to discipline
them, and who is at least wise enough to warn them when the
hour of their departure draws near. But in general ‘the Great
Callicantzaros<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>,’ as he is called, or ‘the lame demon<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>,’ is too like
the rest of them to be of much avail; and indeed his place is not
at the head of the riotous mob where he might control them, but
he limps along, a grotesque and usually ithyphallic figure, in the
rear. Thus in the popular stories it often happens that either
the Callicantzari go on quarrelling about the treatment of some
man or the possession of some woman whom they have captured,
or else their prisoner is shrewd enough to keep them amused,
until cock-crow brings release. For at that sound (or, to be more
precise, at the crowing of the third cock, who is black and more
potent to scare away demons than the white and red cocks who
precede him<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>) they vanish away, like all terrors of the night
in ancient<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> as well as modern times, to their dark lairs.</p>

<p>The tales told by the peasants about the Callicantzari are
extremely numerous, though there is a certain sameness about
the main themes. Three types of story however are deserving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
of notice, to illustrate the character of the Callicantzari and the
ways in which they may be outwitted and eluded.</p>

<p>The first type may be represented by a tale told to me in
Scyros in explanation of the name of a cave some half-hour
distant from the town. Both the cave itself and that part of
the path which lies just below it are popularly called <span class="greek">τοῦ
καλλικαντζάρου τὸ ποδάρι</span>, ‘the Callicantzaros’ foot.’ My enquiries
concerning the name elicited the following story, which
seems incidentally to explain how the Great Callicantzaros came
to be lame.</p>

<p>‘Once upon the eve of Epiphany a man of Scyros was returning
home from a mill late at night, driving his mule before him laden
with two sacks of meal. When he had gone about half-way,
he saw before him some Callicantzari in his path. Realising his
danger, he at once got upon his mule and laid himself flat between
the two sacks and covered himself up with a rug, so as to look
like another sack of meal. Soon the Callicantzari were about his
mule, and he held his breath and heard them saying, “Here is
a pack on this side and a pack on that side, and the top-load in
the middle, but where is the man?” So they ran back to the mill
thinking that he had loitered behind; but they could not find
him and came back after the mule, and looked again, and said,
“Here is a pack on this side and a pack on that side, and the
top-load in the middle, but where is the man?” So they ran on in
front fearing that he had hasted on home before his mule. But
when they could not find him, they returned again, and said as
before, and went back a second time towards the mill. And thus
it happened many times. Now while they were running to and
fro, the mule was nearing home, and it so happened that when the
beast stopped at the door of the man’s house, the Callicantzari were
close on his track. The man therefore called quickly to his wife
and she opened the door and he entered in safety, but the mule
was left standing without. Then the Callicantzari saw how he had
tricked them, and they knocked at the door in great anger. So
the woman, fearing lest they would break in by force, promised to
open to them on condition that they should first count for her the
holes in her sieve. To this they agreed, and she let it down to
them by a cord from a window. Straightway they set to work
to count, and counted round and round the outermost circle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
never got nearer to the middle; nor could they discover how this
came to pass, but only counted more and more hurriedly, without
advancing at all. Meanwhile dawn was breaking, and so soon
as the neighbours perceived the Callicantzari, they hurried off to
the priests and told them. The priests immediately set out with
censers and sprinkling-vessels in their hands, to chase the Callicantzari
away. Right through the town the monsters fled,
spreading havoc in their path and hotly pursued by the priests.
At last when they were clear of the town, one Callicantzaros
began to lag behind, and by a great exertion the foremost priest
came up to him and struck him on the hinder foot with his
sprinkling vessel. At once the foot fell off, but the Callicantzaros
fled away maimed though he was. And thus the spot came to be
known as “the Callicantzaros’ foot.”’</p>

<p>This story consists of three episodes. The first, in which
the driver of the mule outwits the Callicantzari by lying flat on
the animal’s back and making himself look like a sack of meal,
occurs time after time in the popular tales with hardly any
variation; indeed it often forms in itself the <i>motif</i> of a whole story,
in which, as soon as the man reaches his home, the cock crows
and the Callicantzari flee. The second episode in which the wife
effects some delay by bargaining with the Callicantzari that they
shall count the holes in a sieve, is also fairly common, but the
difficulty which the monsters find, in every other version of which
I know, is that they dare not pronounce the word ‘three,’ and
so go on counting ‘one, two,’ ‘one, two’ till cock-crow<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>. The third
episode in which the priests chase away the Callicantzari is not
often found in current stories, but the belief that the <span class="greek">ἁγιασμός</span>
or ‘hallowing’ which takes place on the morning of Epiphany
is the signal for the final departure of the Callicantzari is firmly
held throughout Greece. This ceremony consists primarily in
‘blessing the waters’&mdash;whether of the sea, of rivers, of village-wells,
or, as at Athens, of the reservoir&mdash;by carrying a cross in procession
to the appointed place and throwing it in; but in many districts
also the priests afterwards fill vessels with the blest waters, and
with these and their censers make a round of the village, sprinkling
and purifying the people and their houses and cornfields and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
vineyards. The fear which the Callicantzari feel of this purification
is embodied in some rough lines which they are supposed to chant
as they disappear at Twelfth-night:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">φύγετε, νὰ φύγουμε,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τ’ ἔφτασ’ ὁ τουρλόπαπας</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">μὲ τὴν ἁγι̯αστοῦρα του</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">καὶ μὲ τὴ βρεχτοῦρα του,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He has purified the streams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he has polluted us.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the actual tales however as told by the people the intervention
of the priests is not a common episode. More often the
story ends in a rescue effected by neighbours armed with firebrands,
of which the Callicantzari go in mortal terror, or simply with the
crowing of the black cock.</p>

<p>The second type of story deals with the adventures of a girl
sent by her wicked stepmother to a mill during the dangerous
Twelve Days, nominally to get some corn ground, but really in
the hope that she will fall a prey to the Callicantzari. Having
arrived at the mill the girl calls in vain to the miller to come and
help unload her mule, and entering in search of him finds him
bound to his chair or dead with fright and the Callicantzari
standing about him. They at once seize the girl, and begin to
quarrel which shall have her for his own. But the girl keeps her
wits, and says that she will be the wife of the one who brings her
the best bridal array. So they disperse in search of fine raiment
and jewels. Meanwhile she sets to work to grind the corn, and
each time a Callicantzaros returns with presents, she sends him on
a fresh errand for something more. Finally the corn is all ground,
and she quickly loads the mule with two sacks, one on either side,
clothes herself in the gold and jewels which the Callicantzari have
brought, mounts the mule and lies flat on the saddle covered over
with a sack, and eluding the Callicantzari who pursue her, like the
muleteer in the previous story, reaches home in safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span></p>

<p>The wicked stepmother seeing that her plans have miscarried
and that her stepdaughter is now rich while her own daughter is
poor, determines to send the latter the next evening to the mill.
She too finds the mill occupied by the Callicantzari, but not being
so shrewd as her half-sister either falls a victim to the lust of the
monsters, or is killed and eaten by them, or, in one version<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>, is
stripped of her own clothes, dressed in the skin of her mule which
the Callicantzari have killed and flayed, and sent home with a
necklace of the mule’s entrails about her neck.</p>

<p>The third type of story, one which is known all over Greece,
introduces us to the domestic circle of a Callicantzaros. A midwife
is roused one night during the Twelve Days by a furious
rapping at her door, and, imagining that the call is urgent, slips
on her clothes in haste without enquiring who it is that needs her
services, and stepping out of her door finds herself face to face
either with an unmistakeable Callicantzaros who seizes her and
carries her off, or else with a man unknown to her who subsequently
proves to be a Callicantzaros<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>. On their way to his
home he bids her see to it that the child with which his wife
is about to present him be male; in that case he will reward her
handsomely; but if a female child be born, he will devour the midwife.
Arrived at the cave or house where the Callicantzaros dwells,
the midwife goes about her task, and the Callicantzaros’ wife is
soon delivered of a child; but to the midwife’s horror it is female.
Her wits however do not desert her, and she quickly devises a
scheme for her escape. Taking a candle, she warms it and fashions
from the wax a model of the male organs and fastens it to the
child. Then calling the Callicantzaros, she tells him that a fine
male child is born and holds up the infant for him to see. Thereat
he is content and bids her swaddle it. This done, she craves leave
to go home, and the Callicantzaros, true to his word, rewards her
with a sack of gold and lets her go.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the story varies. In some versions, the
fraud is discovered before the midwife reaches her home, the
Callicantzaros curses the gold which he has given her, and when
she opens her sack she finds nothing but ashes. In others, she
reaches home in safety with the gold and by magic means breaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the power of the Callicantzaros over his gift; and when he arrives
at her door in hot pursuit, she has already taken all precautions
against his entrance and lies secure and silent within.</p>

<p>The wife of the Callicantzaros here mentioned is in some
stories pictured as being of the same monstrous species as himself,
in others as an ordinary woman whom he has seized and carried
off. But, apart from these stories in which she is a necessary
<i>persona dramatis</i>, she has no hold upon the popular imagination.
A feminine word, <span class="greek">καλλικαντζαρίνα</span> or <span class="greek">καλλικαντζαροῦ</span>, has been
formed in this case just as the word <span class="greek">νεραΐδης</span><a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> has been formed
as masculine of Nereid (<span class="greek">νεράϊδα</span>), and female Callicantzari are as
rare and local as male Nereids. Their existence is assumed only
as complementary to that of their mates.</p>

<p>Security from the Callicantzari is sought by many methods,
some of them Christian in character, others magical or pagan.
Foremost among Christian precautions is the custom of marking
a cross in black upon the house-door on Christmas Eve; and the
same emblem is sometimes painted upon the various jars and
vessels in which food is kept to ensure them against befouling by
the Callicantzari, and even upon the forehead of infants, especially
if they are unbaptised, to prevent them from being stolen or
strangled<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> by the monsters. If in spite of these precautions the
inmates of any house are troubled by them, the burning of incense
is accounted an effectual safeguard. For out-door use, if a man is
unfortunate enough to encounter Callicantzari, an invocation of
the Trinity or the recitation of three Paternosters is recommended.</p>

<p>But precautions of a more pagan character are often preferred
to these or combined with them. Ordinary prudence demands
that the fire be kept burning through all the Twelve Days, to
prevent the Callicantzari entering by the chimney, and the usual
custom is to set one huge log on end up the chimney, to go on
burning for the whole period. In addition to this a fire is sometimes
kept burning at night close by the house-door. Certain
herbs also, such as ground-thistle<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>, hyssop, and asparagus<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>, may be
suspended at the door or the chimney-place, as magical charms.
If even then there is reason to suspect that Callicantzari are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
prowling round the house, the golden rule is to observe strict
silence and, above all, not to answer any question asked from without
the door; for it is commonly believed that the Callicantzari,
like the Nereids, can deprive of speech any who have once talked
with them. At the same time it is wise to make up the fire,
throwing on either something which will crackle like salt or heather<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>,
or something which will smell strong, such as a bit of leather,
an old shoe, wild-cherry wood<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>, or ground-thistle; for the stench
of these is as unbearable to the Callicantzari as that of incense.</p>

<p>Such at any rate is the current explanation of the purpose of
these malodorous combustibles; but in view of the notorious
gullibility of the Callicantzari I am tempted to surmise that both
the crackling and the smell were originally intended to pacify
them for a while with the delusive hope that a share of the
Christmas pork, their favourite food, was being prepared for them.
For certainly even now propitiatory presents to the Callicantzari
are not unknown. At Portariá and other villages of Mount Pelion
it is the custom to hang a rib or other bone from the pork inside
the chimney ‘for the Callicantzari,’ but whether as a means of
appeasement or of aversion the people seem no longer to know:
in Samos however the first sweetmeats made at the New Year are
placed in the chimney avowedly as food for the Callicantzari<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>, and
in Cyprus waffles and sausages are put in the same place as a farewell
feast to them on the Eve of Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>. Moreover in earlier
times the custom of appeasing them with food was undoubtedly
more widespread; for in places where, so far as I know, the custom
itself no longer exists, a few lines supposed to be sung by the
Callicantzari on the eve of their departure are still remembered,
in which they ask for ‘a little bit of sausage, a morsel of waffle,
that the Callicantzari may eat and depart to their own place<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.’</p>

<p>But propitiation of the Callicantzari, in spite of this evidence
of offerings made to them, is certainly not now so much in vogue
as precautions against them; and it is perhaps simpler to suppose
that the choice of crackling or odorous fuel was originally prompted
by the intention of conveying to the Callicantzari a plain warning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
that the fire within the house was burning briskly; for apart from
the Christian means of defence&mdash;crosses, incense, invocations and
the general purification on the morning of Epiphany&mdash;it may be
said that the one thing which they really fear is fire. Everywhere
it is held that so long as a good fire is kept burning on the hearth
the Callicantzari cannot gain access to the house by their favourite
entrance; and that the utmost they will venture is to vent their
urine down the chimney in the hope of extinguishing the fire.
For this reason the wood-ashes from the hearth, which are
generally stored up and used in the washing of clothes, are during
the Twelve Days left untouched, and after the purification at
Epiphany are carried out of the house; but in some districts<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>,
though the ashes are not thought suitable for ordinary use,
they are not thrown away as worthless impurities, but, owing
I suppose to their contact with supernatural beings, are held
to be endowed with magically fertilising properties and are
sprinkled over the very same fields and gardens which the priests
have sprinkled with holy water. Again there are not a few stories
current<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> in which a Callicantzaros, attracted to some house at
Christmas-tide by the smell of roasting pork, has been put to rout
by having the hot joint or the spit on which it was turning thrust
in his face. In one version also of the song which the Callicantzari
are supposed to sing as they depart, ‘the pot-bellied priest with
censer and sprinkling-vessel’ is accompanied by his wife carrying
hot water to scald them<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. In other stories again the rescue of a
man from the clutches of Callicantzari is effected by his neighbours
with fire-brands as their only weapons; and where such help
cannot be obtained, a man may sometimes free himself merely by
ejaculating <span class="greek">ξύλα, κούτσουρα, δαυλιὰ καμμένα</span>, ‘sticks, logs, and
brands ablaze!’ for the very thought of fire will sometimes scare
the monsters away.</p>

<p>Other safeguards are also mentioned; you are recommended for
instance to keep a black cock in the house, or you may render the
Callicantzaros harmless by binding him with a red thread or a
straw rope<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>; but the latter method would in most cases be like
putting salt on a bird’s tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<p>Such, on a general view, are the monsters whose origin I now
propose to examine; and the first step in the investigation must
be to account for the extraordinary variations in shape exhibited
by the Callicantzari in different districts.</p>

<p>I have already observed that the Callicantzari are sometimes
conceived to be of ordinary human form, but that more commonly
there is an admixture of something beast-like. Among the
animals which are laid under contribution, first comes the he-goat,
from which the Callicantzari borrow ears, horns, and legs. Almost
equally common is a presentment of Callicantzari with the ears
and the legs of an ass combined with a body in other respects
human; or again the head of an ass, according to Pouqueville<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>,
may be combined with the body and legs of a man. In other
districts again the wolf has once been a factor in the conception
of Callicantzari. Thus in Messenia, in Cynouria (a district in the
east of Laconia), and in parts of Crete<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> the Callicantzari are called
also <span class="greek">Λυκοκάντζαροι</span>, in which the first half of the compound name
is undoubtedly <span class="greek">λύκος</span>, ‘wolf.’ Similarly in some parts of Macedonia
Callicantzari are often called simply ‘wolves’ (<span class="greek">λύκοι</span>), and both
names are also applied metaphorically to any particularly ill-favoured
man<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. Resemblances to apes are also mentioned,
particularly in the long, lean, hairy arms of the Callicantzari; and
Pouqueville speaks also of their monkey-like tails<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>. Next from
Phoeniciá in Epirus comes the suggestion that Callicantzari may
resemble squirrels; for there they have the two by-names <span class="greek">σκιορίσματα</span>
and <span class="greek">καψιούρηδες</span><a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>, in which it is not hard to recognise the two
ancient Greek names for the squirrel, <span class="greek">σκίουρος</span> and <span class="greek">καμψίουρος</span>.
Concerning the local character of these I have no information;
but it is fairly safe to surmise that they possess the power, commonly
ascribed to the smaller sort of Callicantzari, of climbing
with great dexterity the walls and roofs of houses in order to
gain access by the chimney. Finally in Myconos, as noted above,
the Callicantzari are described as ‘savage four-footed things’&mdash;a
description which need not exclude some human attributes any
more than it does in the savage four-footed Centaurs of ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
art, but implies it would seem at least a predominance of the
bestial over the human element.</p>

<p>What then is the explanation of these wide divergences of
type? The answer is really very simple and final. The Callicantzari
were originally believed to possess the power, which many
supernatural beings share, of transforming themselves at their
pleasure into any shape. The shapes most commonly assumed
differed in different districts, and gradually, as the belief in the
metamorphosis of Callicantzari here, there, and almost everywhere
was forgotten, what had once been the commonest form locally
assumed by Callicantzari became in the several districts their
fixed and only form.</p>

<p>The correctness of this explanation was first proved to me
by information obtained from the best source for all manner of
stories and traditions about the Callicantzari, the villages on
Mount Pelion. There I was definitely told that the Callicantzari
are believed to have the power of assuming any monstrous
shape which they choose; and the accuracy of this statement
is, I find, now confirmed by information obtained independently
by Prof. Polites<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> from one of these same villages, Portariá;
he adds that there the shapes most frequently affected by
Callicantzari are those of women, bearded men, and he-goats.
Further evidence of the same belief existing also in Cyprus is
adduced by the same writer. ‘The Planetari (<span class="greek">πλανήταροι</span>),’ so
runs the popular tradition which he quotes from a work which
I have been unable to consult, ‘who are also called in some parts
of Cyprus Callicantzari, come to the earth at Christmas and
remain all the Twelve Days. They are seen by persons who are
<span class="greek">ἀλαφροστοίχει̯ωτοι</span><a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> (i.e., to give the nearest equivalent, ‘fey’).
Sometimes they appear as dogs, sometimes as hares, sometimes as
donkeys or as camels, and often as bobbins. Men who are ‘fey’
stumble over them, and stoop down to pick them up, when suddenly
the bobbin rolls along of its own accord and escapes them. Further
on it turns into a donkey or camel and goes on its way. The man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
is deceived (by its appearance) and mounts it, and the donkey
grows as tall as a mountain and throws the man down from a
great height<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>, and he returns home half-dead, and if he does not
die outright, he will be an invalid all his life<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>.’</p>

<p>Linguistic evidence is also forthcoming that the same belief in
the metamorphosis of these monsters was once held both in Epirus
and in Samos. The by-name <span class="greek">σκιορίσματα</span>, recorded from Phoeniciá,
proves more than the squirrel-form of Callicantzari; it implies
that that shape is not natural but assumed. From the ancient
word <span class="greek">σκίουρος</span>, comes by natural formation an hypothetical verb
<span class="greek">σκιουρίζω</span>, ‘I become a squirrel,’ and thence the existing substantive
<span class="greek">σκιούρισμα</span> or <span class="greek">σκιόρισμα</span> (for this difference in vocalisation
is negligible in modern Greek) meaning ‘that which has
turned into a squirrel.’ Similarly in Samos the by-name <span class="greek">κακανθρωπίσματα</span>
means ‘those that have turned into evil men.’
Whether the belief implied by these names is still alive in
Epirus, I do not know; in Samos it has apparently died out,
for the word <span class="greek">κακανθρωπίσματα</span> is popularly there interpreted to
mean ‘those who do evil to men<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>’&mdash;a meaning which the formation
really precludes.</p>

<p>Since then the belief that Callicantzari possess the power of
metamorphosis either obtains now or has once obtained in places
as far removed from one another as Phoeniciá in Epirus, Mount
Pelion, Samos, and Cyprus, it is reasonable to conclude that this
quality was in earlier times universally attributed to them, and
therewith the whole problem of their multifarious presentments
in different districts is at once solved.</p>

<p>The next question which arises is this; if the various forms in
which the Callicantzari are locally represented are, so to speak, so
many disguises assumed by them at their own will, what is the
normal form of the Callicantzaros when he is not exercising his
power of self-transformation? On reviewing the various shapes
assumed, one fact stands out clearly; it is the animal attributes
of the Callicantzari which are variable, while the human element
in their composition (with a possible exception in the case of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
‘savage quadrupeds’ of Myconos) is constant. But the variation
of form results, as has been shown, from the power of transformation.
Therefore the animal characteristics, which are variable, are
the characteristics assumed at pleasure by the Callicantzari, and
the constant or human element in their composition indicates
their normal form. In other words, the Callicantzaros in his
original and natural shape was anthropomorphic, as indeed he is
sometimes still represented to be.</p>

<p>And here too, while the various types of Callicantzari are still
before us, it is worth while to notice, at the cost of a short digression,
a curious principle which seems to govern the representation of
Callicantzari in those districts in which the belief in their power
of metamorphosis has been lost. On Mount Pelion and in Cyprus
the shapes which the Callicantzari are said to assume at will
are those of known and familiar objects&mdash;in the former place
of women, bearded men, and he-goats, in the latter of dogs,
hares, donkeys, and camels&mdash;but always complete and single
shapes whether of man or beast; on the other hand in the large
majority of places in which the remembrance of this power
of transformation is lost, the Callicantzari are represented in
fanciful and abnormal shapes&mdash;hybrids as it were between men
and such animals as goat, ass, or ape. What appears to have
happened in these cases is that, as the belief in the metamorphosis
of Callicantzari was lost from the local folklore, a sort
of compensation was made by depicting them arrested in the
process of transformation, arrested halfway in the transition
from man to beast. Now there are very few parts of Greece in
which this change in the superstition has not taken place; and
each island of the Greek seas, each district of the Greek mainland&mdash;I
had almost said each village, for the folklore like the dialect
of two villages no more than an hour’s journey apart may differ
widely&mdash;may be fairly considered to furnish separate instances on
which a general principle can be founded. The law then which
seems to me to have governed the evolution of Greek folklore is
this, that a being of some single, normal, and known shape who
has originally been believed capable of transforming himself into
one or more other single, normal, and known shapes, comes to be
represented, when the belief in his power of transformation dies
out, as a being of composite, abnormal, and fantastic shape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
combining incongruous features of the several single, normal, and
known shapes.</p>

<p>How wide may be the application of this principle, I cannot
pretend to determine; but obviously it may supply the solution
of certain puzzles in ancient Greek mythology. The goddess
Athene, to take but one instance, is in Homer regularly described
as <span class="greek">γλαυκῶπις</span>, an epithet which, though interpreted by ancient
artists in the sense of ‘blue-eyed’ or ‘gray-eyed,’ seems, in view
of Athene’s connexion with the owl, to have meant originally ‘owl-faced’;
for the sake of argument at any rate, without entering
into the controversy on the subject, let me assume this; let it be
granted that the goddess was once depicted as a maiden with an
owl’s face. How is this hybrid form to be explained? If our
principle holds here, the explanation is that in a still earlier stage
of Greek mythology the goddess Athene was wont to transform
herself into an owl and so manifest herself to her worshippers, just
as in early Christian tradition it is recorded that once ‘the Holy
Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>.’</p>

<p>But this digression is long enough. Later in this chapter
I shall have occasion to return to the principle which has been
formulated. At present the Callicantzari are calling.</p>

<p>Thus far our investigation has shown us that the Callicantzari
were originally anthropomorphic, possessing indeed and exercising
the power of transmutation into beast-form, but in their natural and
normal form completely human in appearance. What therefore
remains to be determined is whether these beings were anthropomorphic
demons or simply men.</p>

<p>On this point there is a direct conflict of evidence at the
present day. The very common tradition that the Callicantzari
come from the lower world at Christmas and are driven back there
by the purification at Epiphany; the fact that they are often
mentioned under the vague names <span class="greek">παγανά</span> and <span class="greek">ξωτικά</span> which
have already been discussed<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>, and that their leader is sometimes
called <span class="greek">ὁ κουτσοδαίμονας</span>, ‘the halting demon’; the belief that
they are fond of dancing with the Nereids, and sometimes
exercise also a power, proper to the Nereids, of taking away the
speech of those who speak in their presence; these and other such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
considerations might be thought abundantly to prove that the
Callicantzari were a species of demon.</p>

<p>But on the other hand there is equally abundant evidence of
the belief that Callicantzari are men who are seized with a kind
of bestial madness which often effects a beast-like alteration
in their appearance. This madness is not chronic, but recurrent
with each returning Christmas, and the victim of it displays for
the time being all the savage and lustful passions of a wild
animal. The mountaineers of South Euboea for example have
acquired the reputation of being Callicantzari and are much feared
by the dwellers on the coast.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature in this form of the superstition is the idea
that the madness is congenital. Children born on Christmas-day,
or according to some accounts on any day between Christmas and
Epiphany, are deemed likely to become Callicantzari. This, it is
naively said, is the due punishment for the sin of a mother who
has presumed to conceive and to bring forth at seasons sacred to
the Mother of God; whence also the children are called <span class="greek">ἑορτοπιάσματα</span>
or ‘feast-stricken.’ In Chios, in the seventeenth century,
this superstition was so strong that extraordinary methods of
barbarism were adopted to render such children harmless. They
were taken, says Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>, to a fire which had been lighted in
the market-place, and there the soles of their feet were exposed to
the heat until the nails were singed and the danger of their attacks
obviated. A modern and modified form of this treatment is to
place the child in an oven and to light a fire outside to frighten
it, and then to ask the question, ‘Bread or meat?’ If the child
says ‘bread,’ all is well; but if he says ‘meat,’ he is believed to be
possessed by a savage craving for human flesh, and the treatment
is continued till he answers ‘bread<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>.’</p>

<p>These infant Callicantzari are particularly prone, it is said,
to attack and kill their own brothers and sisters. Hence comes
the by-name by which they are sometimes known, <span class="greek">ἀδερφοφᾶδες</span>,
‘brother-eaters,’ as also, according to Polites’ interpretation, the
name <span class="greek">κάηδες</span>, which is an equivalent for Callicantzari in several
islands of the Aegean Sea. This word Polites holds to be the
plural of the name Cain, and to denote ‘brother-slayers’; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
inasmuch as a longer form <span class="greek">καϊμπίλιδες</span> appears side by side with
<span class="greek">κάηδες</span> in Carpathos<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>, I hesitate to accept this interpretation
of the one while the other remains to me wholly unintelligible.
At any rate to the people themselves the word has ceased to
convey any idea of murderous propensities; for in the island of
Syme, where the name is in use, the beings denoted by it are held
to be harmless<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.</p>

<p>The issue before us is well summarised in two popular traditions
which Polites adduces from Oenoë and from Tenos, and which are
in clear mutual contradiction. The tradition of Oenoë begins
thus: ‘“Leave-us-good-sirs” (<span class="greek">Ἀς-ἐμᾶς-καλοί</span>) is the name which
we give them (the Callicantzari), though they are really evil
demons (<span class="greek">ξωτικά</span>).’ The tradition of Tenos opens with the words:
‘The Callicantzari are not demons (<span class="greek">ζωτ’κά</span>)<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>; they are men; as
New Year’s Day approaches, they are stricken with a fit of
madness and leave their houses and wander to and fro.’ How are
we to decide which of these two traditions is the older?</p>

<p>The evidence in favour of either is at the present day abundant;
the two chief authorities on the subject, Schmidt and Polites, both
acknowledge this; and, in my own experience, I should have
difficulty in saying which view of the Callicantzari I have the more
frequently heard expressed. On the mainland they are most
commonly demons; in the islands of the Aegean, more usually
human. But in a matter of this kind it would be of no value to
count heads; even if the whole population of Greece could be
polled on the question, the view of the majority would have no
more value than that of the minority. The issue must be decided
on other than numerical grounds.</p>

<p>And clearly the first consideration which suggests itself must
be the nature of the earliest evidence on the subject. The earliest
authority then is Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>, and his statement is in brief as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
follows. Children born in the octave of Christmas are seized with
a kind of madness; they rage to and fro with incredible swiftness;
and their nails grow sharp like talons. To any wayfarer whom
they meet they put the question ‘Tow or lead?’ If he answer
‘tow,’ he escapes unhurt; if he answer ‘lead,’ they crush him
with all their power and leave him half-dead, lacerated by their
talons.</p>

<p>Thus far the testimony of Leo Allatius distinctly favours the
belief that Callicantzari are human and not demoniacal in origin;
but at the same time it must be admitted that his statement was
probably founded upon the particular traditions of his native
island only and carries therefore less weight. The barbarous custom
however which he next proceeds to describe is of some importance.
He states that children born during the dangerous period between
Christmas and New Year had the soles of their feet scorched
until the nails were singed and so they could not become Callicantzari.
Now there is a small but obvious inconsistency in this
statement. Persons who scratch one another use, presumably,
not their toe-nails but their finger-nails; and animals likewise
employ the fore feet and not the hind feet. To scorch the feet
therefore, and particularly the soles of the feet, is not a logical
method of preventing the growth of talons. But on the other
hand the treatment adopted might well be supposed to prevent
the development of hoofs, such as in many parts of Greece the
Callicantzari are still believed to have. In other words, the
custom which Leo Allatius describes was not properly understood
in his time. But a custom which has ceased to be properly understood
and has had an inaccurate interpretation set upon it is
necessarily of considerable age. Already therefore in the first half
of the seventeenth century the custom which Allatius describes
was of some antiquity; and the belief that children turn into
Callicantzari, which is implied alike by the original meaning and
by the later interpretation of the custom, was equally ancient.
In Chios then at any rate the human origin of Callicantzari is a
very old article of faith.</p>

<p>But more important for our consideration is the answer to be
made to the following question; is it more probable, that Callicantzari,
if they were originally demons, should have come in the belief of
many people to be men, or that, being originally men, they should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
have assumed in the belief of many people the rank of demons?
Here, if I may trust the analogy of other instances in Greek folklore,
my answer is decided. I know of no case in which a demon
has lost status and been reduced to human rank; but I can name
three several cases in which beings originally human have been
elevated to the standing of demons. The human maiden Gello
was the prototype of the class of female demons now known as
Gelloudes. Striges (<span class="greek">στρίγγλαις</span>) are properly old women who by
magical means can transform themselves into birds, but they too
both in mediaeval and in modern times are frequently confused
with demons. ‘Arabs’ (<span class="greek">Ἀράπηδες</span>), as the name itself implies,
were originally nothing but men of colour, but they now form, as
will be shown in the next section, a recognised class of <i>genii</i>.
And if we turn from modern Greek folklore to ancient Greek
religion, there also we find the tendency in the same direction.
There men in plenty are elevated to the rank of hero, demon, or
god, but the degradation of a demon to human rank is a thing
unknown. In view of this strongly marked principle of Greek
superstition or religion, it is impossible to come to any other
conclusion than that the Callicantzari were originally not demons
but men&mdash;men who either voluntarily or under the compulsion
of a kind of madness chose or were forced to assume the shape
and the character of beasts.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of the problem presented by the various
types of Callicantzari, we must next investigate the origin of the
name itself. This investigation too is not a little complicated
by the fact that the dialectic varieties of the name are fully as
manifold and divergent as the various shapes which the monsters
are locally believed to assume. There can be few words in the
Greek language which better illustrate the difference in speech
between one district and another. The most general form of the
word, and one which is either used side by side with other
dialectic forms or at least is understood in almost every district,
is the form which I have used throughout this chapter <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>
or, to transliterate it, Callicantzaros; but in reviewing all the
dialectic varieties of the word, I find that there are only two out
of the fourteen letters composing this word, which do not, in one
dialect or another, suffer either modification of sound or change of
position. The consonant <span class="greek">κ</span> in the first syllable and the vowel <span class="greek">α</span> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the third are the only constant and uniform elements common to
all dialects.</p>

<p>These dialectic forms demand consideration for the reason that
some of the derivations proposed take as their starting-point not
the common form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span> but one of the rarer by-forms&mdash;a
method which is evidently open to objection when it is seen, as
the accompanying table of forms will show, that <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>,
besides being the common and normal form, is also the centre
from which all the dialectic varieties radiate in different directions.
In compiling my list of forms, however, I may abbreviate it by
the omission of those which are a matter of calligraphic rather
than of phonetic distinction. Thus the first two syllables of
<span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span> are often written <span class="greek">καλι-</span> or <span class="greek">καλη-</span>, but since <span class="greek">ι</span> and
<span class="greek">η</span> represent exactly the same sound and <span class="greek">λλ</span> is very seldom
distinguished from <span class="greek">λ</span>, I have uniformly written <span class="greek">καλλι-</span> even
where my authority for the particular form uses some other
spelling. On the other hand, as regards the use of <span class="greek">τζ</span> or <span class="greek">τσ</span>,
between which there is a real if somewhat subtle difference in
sound, I have retained the particular form which I have found
recorded.</p>

<p>Starting then from the normal form <span class="greek">καλ-λι-κάν-τζα-ρος</span>, which
I thus dismember for convenience of reference to its five syllables,
I may classify the changes which the word undergoes in various
dialects as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) The insertion of <span class="greek">α</span> in the second syllable, giving <span class="greek">λι̯α</span> in
the place of <span class="greek">λι</span>.</li>

<li>(2) The prefixing of <span class="greek">σ</span> to the first syllable, giving <span class="greek">σκαλ</span> for
<span class="greek">καλ</span>. With this Bernhard Schmidt well compares the modern
<span class="greek">σκόνη</span> for <span class="greek">κόνις</span>, and <span class="greek">σκύφτω</span> for <span class="greek">κύπτω</span>.</li>

<li>(3) The complete suppression of the second syllable, or the
retention of the <span class="greek">ι</span> only as a faintly pronounced y.</li>

<li>(4) Combined with, and consequent upon, the suppression
of the second syllable, the change of <span class="greek">λ</span> to <span class="greek">ρ</span> in the first syllable, or
the interchange of the <span class="greek">λ</span> in the first syllable with the <span class="greek">ρ</span> in the
fifth.</li>

<li>(5) The loss of either <span class="greek">ν</span> in the third syllable or <span class="greek">τ</span> in the
fourth.</li>

<li>(6) The change of the <span class="greek">α</span> in the first syllable to <span class="greek">ο</span>.</li>

<li>(7) The change of the <span class="greek">α</span> in the third syllable to <span class="greek">ε, ι, ο</span>, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
<span class="greek">ου</span>. Instances of this are most frequent in combination with the
changes under (4).</li>

<li>(8) The interchange of the <span class="greek">κ</span> in the third syllable with the
<span class="greek">τζ</span> (or <span class="greek">τσ</span>) in the fourth. The <span class="greek">νκ</span> thus produced becomes <span class="greek">γγ</span>.</li>

<li>(9) The formation of diminutive neuter forms ending in <span class="greek">-ι</span>
instead of the masculine forms in <span class="greek">-ος</span>, with the consequent shift of
accent from the third to the fourth syllable, the <span class="greek">-ι</span> representing <span class="greek">-ιον</span>.
These neuter forms occur chiefly in the plural.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further it may be noted that the formation of the nominative
plural of the masculine forms shows some variation; the ordinary
form is in <span class="greek">-οι</span> with the accent on the antepenultimate as in the
nominative singular; a second form has the same termination but
with the accent shifted to the penultimate, as commonly happens
in some dialects with words of the second declension (e.g. <span class="greek">ἄνθρωπος</span>
with plural <span class="greek">ἀνθρώποι</span>) by assimilation to the other cases of the
plural; while a third form has the anomalous termination <span class="greek">-αῖοι</span>
(e.g. in Cephallenia, <span class="greek">σκαλλικάντσαρος</span> with plural <span class="greek">σκαλλικαντσαραῖοι</span>).</p>

<p>The following genealogical table exhibits the dialectic progeny
of the normal form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>. The numeral or numerals
placed against each form refer to the classification of phonetic
changes as above. Beneath each form is noted the name of one
place or district (though of course there are usually more) in
which it may be heard, or, failing the <i>provenance</i>, the authority
for its existence.</p>

<p>This table of dialectic forms, which was originally based mainly
upon the information of Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> and my own observations and
has now been enlarged with the aid of Polites’ new work<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>, is even
so probably far from complete; nor have I included in it, for
reasons to be stated, the following forms: <span class="greek">καλκάνια</span><a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> (<span class="greek">τὰ</span>) which is
apparently an abbreviated diminutive formed from the first two
syllables of <span class="greek">καλκάν-τζαρος</span> with a neuter termination, and is therefore
a nickname rather than a strict derivative: <span class="greek">καλκαγάροι</span> which
Bent<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> represents to be the usual form in Naxos and Paros, but
I hesitate to accept without confirmation from some other source:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
<span class="greek">σκατσάντζαροι</span><a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>, a Macedonian form, and <span class="greek">καλκατζόνια</span>, a diminutive
form from the district of Cynouria, both so extraordinarily corrupt
that I can find no place for them in the table: <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαροι</span>, which
has been thought to be <span class="greek">κολλικάντζαρος</span> with the first two syllables
reversed in order&mdash;a change to which I can find no parallel&mdash;but
is, as I shall show later, a distinct and very important compound
of the word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>: and lastly <span class="greek">καλι̯οντζῆδες</span><a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> which has nothing
at all to do with <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαροι</span> etymologically, but is an euphemistic
and not particularly good pun upon it, really meaning
the ‘sailors of a galleon<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>’ (Turkish <i>qālioundji</i>), and humorously
substituted for the dreaded name of the Callicantzari.</p>

<p>To conclude this compilation, it must be added that the wives
of Callicantzari are denoted by feminine forms with the termination
<span class="greek">-ίνα</span> or <span class="greek">-οῦ</span>, and their children by neuter forms ending in <span class="greek">-άκι</span> or
<span class="greek">-οῦδι</span> in place of the masculine <span class="greek">-ος</span>.</p>

<p>From a careful analysis of this material two main facts seem
to emerge. First, the form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>, the commonest in
use, is also the centre from which the other dialectic forms diverge in
many directions; and therefore if one of the rarer dialectic forms be
selected as the parent-form and the basis of any etymological explanation,
the advocate of the particular etymology not only assumes the
burden of showing how his original form came to be so generally
superseded by the form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>, but also will require many
more steps in his genealogical table of existing varieties of the
word. Secondly, the words <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span> and <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span>
(if, as I hold, they cannot be connected through the mediation of
the form <span class="greek">κολλικάντζαρος</span>) show that we have to deal with a
compound word of which the second half is <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>: and
corroboration of this view is afforded by the existence of a form
of the uncompounded word in the dialect of Cynouria, where <span class="greek">σκατζάρια</span><a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
(<span class="greek">τὰ</span>)&mdash;i.e. a diminutive form of <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> with <span class="greek">σ</span> prefixed
and <span class="greek">ν</span> lost&mdash;is used side by side with the words <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαροι</span>
and <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαροι</span> to denote the same beings.</p>

<p>In view of the latter inference, or perhaps even apart from it,
there is no need to delay long over a derivation propounded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
a Greek writer, Oeconomos, whose theory, that ‘callicantzaros’
is a corruption of the Latin ‘caligatus’ or perhaps of ‘calcatura,’
suggests a vision of a monster in hob-nailed boots which does
more credit to its author’s imagination than to his knowledge of
philology.</p>

<p>A suggestion which deserves at any rate more serious consideration
is that of Bernhard Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> who holds that the word is
of Turkish origin and passed first into Albanian and thence into
Greek&mdash;reversing, that is, the steps indicated in the above table.
But to this there are several objections, each weighty in itself, and
cumulatively overwhelming.</p>

<p>First, if the Turkish word <i>karakondjolos</i> be the source from
which the multitude of Greek forms, including in that case <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span><a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
are derived, it ought to be shown how the Turkish
word itself came to mean anything like ‘were-wolf<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>.’ It is compounded,
says Schmidt, of <i>kara</i>, ‘black,’ and <i>kondjolos</i> which is
connected with <i>koundjul</i>, a word which means a ‘slave of the
lowest kind<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>.’ But before that derivation can be accepted, it
should be shown what link in thought may exist between a slave
even of the lowest and blackest variety and a were-wolf, and also
how the supposed Turkish compound came to have the Greek
termination <span class="greek">-ος</span>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the theory that the Greeks borrowed the word, and
presumably also the notion which it expressed, from the Turks
contravenes historical probability. For when did the supposed
borrowing take place? Evidently not before the Ottoman influence
had made itself thoroughly felt in Eastern Europe not only in war
but in peace; for only those peoples who are living side by side
in friendly, or at the least pacific, relations, are in a way to
exchange views on the subject of were-wolves or any other
superstitions; and in the case of the Greeks and the Turks
such intercourse would certainly have been retarded by religious
as well as racial animosity. Presumably then, even if the transference
of the word from the Turkish to the Greek language had
been direct and not, as Schmidt somewhat unnecessarily supposes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
through the medium of Albanian, two or three generations must
have elapsed after the Ottoman occupation of Chios in 1566<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>, and
the seventeenth century must have well begun, before the Greeks
of that island even began to adopt the new word and the new superstition
involved in it. Yet the form of the word familiar to
Leo Allatius since the beginning of that century, when he lived
as a boy in Chios, was not <i>karakondjolos</i> or anything like it, but
<i>callicantzaros</i>; while the belief that children born in the octave
of Christmas became Callicantzari was of such antiquity in Chios
that a custom founded upon it had already come, as I have
shown, to be misinterpreted. Indeed, as the same writer tells us,
the Callicantzari and their haunts and habits were so familiar to
the people of Chios that two proverbs of the island referred to
them. One, which was addressed to persons always appearing in
the same clothes&mdash;<span class="greek">βάλλε τίποτε καινούριο ἀπάνω σου διὰ τοὺς
καλλικαντζάρους</span>, ‘put on something new because of the Callicantzari’&mdash;is
more than a little obscure; it would seem to imply that
the clothes which were being worn would hardly be worth the
while even of the mischief-loving Callicantzari to tear; but in any
case the very existence of an obscure proverb is evidence that the
Callicantzaros and all his ways had long been a matter of common
knowledge. The second saying&mdash;<span class="greek">ἐκατέβης ἀπὸ τὰ τριποτάματα</span>,
‘You have come down from the Three Streams,’ or in
another version, <span class="greek">δὲν πᾶς ’στα τριποτάματα</span>; ‘Why not go to the
Three Streams?’&mdash;was addressed to mad persons, because, as
Allatius explains, ‘the Three Streams’ was a wild wooded place
in Chios reputed to be the haunt of Callicantzari. Historically
then the theory that the people of Chios borrowed from the
Turks the name and the conception of the Callicantzari is untenable.</p>

<p>Another piece of historical evidence against Schmidt’s theory
is that the Callicantzaros of the present day appears to be identical
with the ‘baboutzicarios’ whereof Michael Psellus<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> discoursed in
the eleventh century. He himself indeed, with his usual passion
for explaining away popular superstitions, affirms that ‘baboutzicarios’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
is the same as ‘ephialtes,’ the demon who punishes gluttony
with nocturnal discomfort and a feeling of oppression; and in that
view he was followed by Suidas<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> and other lexicographers; but he
states two important points in the popular superstition which he
combats: the ‘baboutzicarios’ appears only in the octave of
Christmas; and it is at night that he meets and terrifies men.
Moreover the name itself is, I suspect, derived from the Low-Latin
<i>babuztus</i><a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> meaning ‘mad,’ and indicates the existence then of the
belief which is so largely held to-day, that the monstrous apparitions
of Christmastide are really men smitten with a peculiar kind of
madness. Thus all the information which Psellus gives about the
‘baboutzicarios’ tallies with modern beliefs concerning the Callicantzaros,
and militates against the supposition that the Greeks
are indebted for this superstition to the Turks.</p>

<p>Finally there is positive evidence that the Turks borrowed the
word in question from the Greeks; for the time at which they
used to fear the advent of the <i>karakondjolos</i>&mdash;whether the
superstition still remains the same, I do not know&mdash;was fixed
not by their own calendar but by that of the Christians. An
article written on the subject of the Turkish calendar early in last
century contains this statement: ‘The Turks have received this
fabulous belief from the Greeks, and they say that this demon,
whom the former call Kara Kondjolos and the latter Cali
Cangheros, exercises his sway of maleficence and mischief
from Christmas-day until that of the Epiphany<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>.’ Clearly the
Turks would not have fixed the time for the appearance of the
<i>karakondjolos</i> by the Christian festivals if they had not borrowed
the whole superstition from the Greeks; and indeed the very
termination in <span class="greek">-ος</span> of the Turkish form of the word betrays its
Hellenic origin.</p>

<p>The proposed Turkish derivation of the word <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>
must therefore be rejected as finally as Oeconomos’ Latin derivation,
and it remains only to deal with those which treat the word
as genuinely Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span></p>

<p>The first of these is that proposed by Coraës<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>, who made the
word a compound of <span class="greek">καλός</span> and <span class="greek">κάνθαρος</span>. The formation, as
might be expected of so great a scholar, is irreproachable; for
the phonetic change of <span class="greek">θ</span> to <span class="greek">τζ</span>; is seen in the development of the
modern word <span class="greek">καντζόχοιρος</span> (a hedgehog) from the ancient <span class="greek">ἀκανθόχοιρος</span>.
But the meaning obtained is less satisfactory. What
has a ‘good’ or ‘beautiful beetle’ to do with a Callicantzaros
such as I have described? The question remains without an
answer. And yet some of Coraës’ followers in recent times have
thought triumphantly to vindicate his view by pointing out that
in the dialect of Thessaly ‘a species of large horned beetle’ is
known as <span class="greek">καλλικάτζαροι</span>. Now I am aware that elsewhere in
Greece stag-beetles are called <span class="greek">κατζαρίδες</span>, which is undoubtedly
a modern form of the ancient <span class="greek">κάνθαρος</span> and illustrates once more
the phonetic change involved in Coraës’ derivation; and I can
believe that the Thessalian peasantry with a certain rustic humour
sometimes call them <span class="greek">καλλικάτζαροι</span> instead. But what light does
this throw on the supposed development of meaning? The view
which these disciples of Coraës appear to hold, namely that the
Callicantzari, who are known and feared throughout Greek lands
and even beyond them in Turkey and in Albania, were called
after an alleged Thessalian species of Coleoptera, would be fitly
matched by a theory that the Devil was so named after a species
of fish or a printer’s assistant or a patent fire-lighter.</p>

<p>The same objection holds good as against Polites’ first view<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>.
Taking the word <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span> as his starting-point, instead of
the common and central form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>, he proposed to
derive the word from <span class="greek">λύκος</span>, ‘wolf,’ and <span class="greek">κάνθαρος</span>, ‘beetle.’ But
though the resulting hybrid might be a monster as hideous as the
worst of Callicantzari, these creatures so far as I know show no
traits suggestive of entomological parentage. But since Polites
himself has long abandoned this view, there is no need to criticize
it further.</p>

<p>His next pronouncement on the subject<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> banished both wolf
and beetle and seemed to recognise the necessity of keeping the
main form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span> to the fore. But while he naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
assumed <span class="greek">καλός</span> to be the first half of the compound, he could only
set down <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> as an unknown foreign, perhaps Slavonic,
word.</p>

<p>But in his latest publication<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> he relinquishes this position and
falls back once more on a dialectic form <span class="greek">καλιτσάγγαρος</span> which
is reported to be in use at the village of Pyrgos in Tenos and
at some places on the western shores of the Black Sea. This
word he believes to be a compound, of which the second half is
connected with a Byzantine word <span class="greek">τσαγγίον</span>, meaning a kind of
boot, and the still existing, if somewhat rare, word, <span class="greek">τσαγγάρης</span>,
‘a boot-maker,’ while the first half is to be either <span class="greek">καλός</span>, ‘fine,’ or
<span class="greek">καλίκι</span>, ‘a hoof<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>.’ The former alternative provides easily the
form <span class="greek">καλοτσάγγαρος</span> or, as would be almost more likely, <span class="greek">καλλιτσάγγαρος</span>,
meaning ‘one who wears fine boots’; while in the
other alternative there results a supposed original form <span class="greek">καλικοτσάγγαρος</span>,
meaning ‘one who has hoofs instead of boots,’ whence,
by suppression of the third syllable, comes the existing word
<span class="greek">καλιτσάγγαρος</span>, or again, by loss of the first syllable, a supposed
form <span class="greek">λικοτσάγγαρος</span> which developed into <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span>.</p>

<p>On the score of formation the former alternative is unassailable;
but the latter, with its supposed loss of syllables, is more questionable.
The loss of a first syllable is common enough in modern
Greek, where it consists of a vowel only (e.g. <span class="greek">βρίσκω</span><a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> for <span class="greek">εὑρίσκω</span>,
<span class="greek">μέρα</span> for <span class="greek">ἡμέρα</span>, etc.), but the supposed loss of the syllable <span class="greek">κα</span>
would, I think, be hard to parallel. Again the loss of a syllable
in the middle of a word is fairly common either through the suppression
of the vowel <span class="greek">ι</span> (or <span class="greek">η</span>, which is not distinguished from <span class="greek">ι</span> in
sound) as in <span class="greek">καλκάντζαρος</span> for <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>, <span class="greek">ἔρμος</span> for <span class="greek">ἔρημος</span>,
etc., or else when two concurrent syllables begin with the same
consonant, as in <span class="greek">ἀστροπελέκι</span>, ‘a thunderbolt,’ for <span class="greek">ἀστραποπελέκι</span>,
but the loss of the syllable <span class="greek">κο</span> from the form <span class="greek">καλικοτσάγγαρος</span> is
a bold hypothesis.</p>

<p>But on the score of meaning both alternatives are alike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
unconvincing. Polites indeed cites one or two popular traditions
in which the Callicantzari are represented as wearing wooden or
iron shoes&mdash;wherewith no doubt the better to kick and to trample
their victims; and such footgear might, I suppose, be described
ironically as ‘nice boots.’ But to find in this occasional trait the
origin of the word Callicantzaros<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> appears to me a counsel of
despair. Nor does the other alternative commend itself to me
any more. It is of course a widely accepted belief&mdash;and one by
the way which contradicts the traditions just mentioned&mdash;that
the Callicantzari have feet like those of an ass or a goat. But in
describing such a creature no one surely would be likely to say that
it had hoofs ‘instead of boots’&mdash;‘instead of feet’ would be the
natural and reasonable expression. To suppose that the Callicantzari
(or rather, to use the hypothetical form, the <span class="greek">καλικοτσάγγαροι</span>)
are so named because their boot-maker provides them with hoofs
instead of detachable foot-gear, is little short of ludicrous.</p>

<p>But though neither of the proposed derivations will, I think,
win much acceptance, the historical evidence which Polites adduces
in support of his views forms a valuable contribution to the study
of this subject. The inferences which he draws therefrom may
not be correct; but the material which he has collected is of high
interest.</p>

<p>Singling out of the many traditions concerning the Callicantzari
the widely, and perhaps universally, prevalent belief that
their activities are confined to the Twelve Days between Christmas
and Epiphany, he argues that if we can discover the origin of this
limitation, we shall be in a fair way to discover also whence came
the conception of the Callicantzari themselves.</p>

<p>Accordingly he traces the history of winter festivals in Greece,
starting from the period in which the Greeks, in deference to their
Roman masters, adopted the festivals known as the Saturnalia,
the Brumalia, and the Kalándae (for so the celebration of the
Kalends of January was called by the Greeks) in place of their
own old festivals such as the Kronia and some of the festivals of
Dionysus. The change however was more one of name than of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
method of observance<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. The pagan orgies which marked these
festal days were strongly denounced by the Fathers of the Church
from the very earliest times. In the first century of our era,
Timothy, bishop of Ephesus, met with his martyrdom in an
attempt to suppress such a festival. At the end of the fourth
century S. John Chrysostom and, after him, Asterios, bishop of
Amasea, loudly inveighed against the celebration of the Kalandae.
At the end of the seventh century the sixth Oecumenical Council
of the Church promulgated a canon forbidding all these pagan
winter-festivals. But still in the twelfth century, as Balsamon
testifies<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>, the old abuses continued unabated; and there are local
survivals of such festivals at the present day.</p>

<p>The most prominent feature of these celebrations was that men
dressed themselves up in various characters, to represent women,
soldiers, or animals, and thus disguised gave themselves up to the
wildest orgies. At Ephesus it is clear that these orgies included
human sacrifice, and that Bishop Timothy was on one occasion
the victim; for we are told by Photius that he met with his death
in trying to suppress ‘the polluted and blood-stained rites of the
Greeks<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>’; and the same writer speaks of <span class="greek">τὸ καταγώγιον</span>&mdash;so this
particular ceremony was called&mdash;as a ‘devilish and abominable
festival<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>’ in which men ‘took delight in unholy things as if they
were pious deeds<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>.’ And again another account of the same celebration
tells how men with masks on their faces and with clubs in
their hands went about ‘assaulting without restraint free men and
respectable women, perpetrating murders of no common sort and
shedding endless blood in the best parts of the city, as if they
were performing a religious duty (<span class="greek">ὡσανεὶ ἀναγκαῖόν τι καὶ
ψυχωφελὲς πράττοντες</span>)<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>.’</p>

<p>At Amasea, according to Asterios, at the beginning of the
fifth century, things were not much better. The peasants, he
says, who come into the town during the festival ‘are beaten and
outraged by drunken revellers, they are robbed of anything they
are carrying, they have war waged upon them in a time of peace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
they are mocked and insulted in word and in deed<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>.’ Here too
the custom of dressing up was in vogue among those who took
part in the festival&mdash;women’s dress being especially affected.</p>

<p>Again in the seventh century the points specially emphasized
by the canon of the Church are that ‘no man is to put on feminine
dress, nor any woman the dress proper to men, nor yet are masks,
whether comic, satyric, or tragic, to be worn’; and the penalty for
disregard of this ordinance was to be excommunication. Yet for
all these fulminations the old custom continued. The author of
‘the Martyrdom of S. Dasius<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>,’ writing perhaps as late as the
tenth century, speaks of the festival of the Kronia as still
observed in the old way: ‘on the Kalends of January foolish
men, following the custom of the (pagan) Greeks, though they
call themselves Christians, hold a great procession, changing their
own appearance and character, and assuming the guise of the devil;
clothed in goat-skins and with their faces disguised,’ they reject
their baptismal vows and again serve in the devil’s ranks. And
still in the twelfth century these practices obtained not only
among the laity but even among the clergy, some of whom, in
the words of Balsamon<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>, ‘assume various masks and dresses, and
appear in the open nave of the church, sometimes with swords
girt on and in military uniform, other times as monks or even as
quadrupeds.’</p>

<p>Several instances of the continuance of this custom in modern
times have been collected by Polites<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> and others; the savage
orgies of old time have indeed dwindled into harmless mummery;
but their most constant feature, the wearing of strange disguises,
remains unchanged; and the occasion too is still a winter-festival,
either some part of the Twelve Days or the carnival preceding
Lent. From certain facts concerning these modern festivals it
will be manifest that some relation exists between the mummers
who celebrate them and the Callicantzari.</p>

<p>In Crete, where the New Year is thus celebrated, the mummers
are called <span class="greek">καμπουχέροι</span>, while in Achaia a fuller form of the
same word, <span class="greek">κατσιμπουχέροι</span>, is a by-name of the Callicantzari.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
At Portariá on Mount Pelion, each night of the Twelve Days, a
man is dressed up as an ‘Arab,’ wearing an old cloak and having
bells affixed to his clothes. He goes the round of the streets
with a lantern; and the villagers explicitly state that this is done
<span class="greek">γιὰ τὰ καρκαντζέλια</span>, ‘because of the Callicantzari,’ i.e., says
Polites, as a means of getting rid of them. At Pharsala there is
a sort of play at the Epiphany, in which the mummers represent
bride, bridegroom, and ‘Arab’; the Arab tries to carry off
the bride, and the bridegroom defends her. In some parts of
Macedonia similar mumming takes place at the New Year; in
Belbentós the men who take part in it are called ‘Arabs’; at
Palaeogratsana they have the name <span class="greek">ῥουκατζιάρια</span> (evidently another
compound of <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>, but one which I cannot interpret);
formerly also ‘at Kozane and in many other parts of Greece,’
according to a Greek writer in the early part of the nineteenth
century, throughout the Twelve Days boys carrying bells used to
go round the houses, singing songs and having ‘one or more of
their company dressed up with masks and bells and foxes’ brushes
and other such things to give them a weird and monstrous look.’</p>

<p>This custom is evidently identical with one which I myself
saw enacted in Scyros at the carnival preceding Lent. The young
men of the town array themselves in huge capes made of goat-skin,
reaching to the hips or lower, and provided with holes for
the arms. These capes are sometimes made with hoods of the
same material which cover the whole head and face, small holes
being cut for the eyes but none for purposes of respiration. In
other cases the cape covers the shoulders only, leaving the head
free, and the young man contents himself with the blue and white
kerchief, which is the usual head-gear in Scyros, and a roughly
made domino. A third variety of cape is provided with a hood to
cover the back of the head, while the mask for the face is made
of the skin of some small animal such as a weasel, of which
the hind legs and tail are attached to the hood, while the
head and forelegs hang down to the breast of the wearer; eye-holes
are cut in these as in the other forms of mask. These
capes are girt tightly about the waist with a stout cord or
strap, from which are hung all round the body a large number
of bronze goat-bells, of the ordinary shape but of extraordinary
dimensions, some measuring as much as ten inches for the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
diameter. The method by which these bells are attached to the
belt is remarkable, and is designed to permit a large number of
them to be worn without being in any way muffled by contact
with the cape. Each bell is fastened to one end of a curved and
springy stick of about a foot in length, and the other end is
inserted behind the belt from above; the curve and elasticity of
the stick thus cause the bell to hang at some few inches distance
from the body, free to jangle with every motion of the dancer.
Some sixty or seventy of these bells, of various sizes, are worn by
the best-equipped, and the weight of such a number was estimated
by the people of the place as approximately a hundredweight&mdash;no
easy load with which to dance over the narrow, roughly-paved alleys
of ‘steep Scyros.’ Those however who lack either the prowess or
the accoutrements to share in the glorious fatigue do not abstain
altogether from the festivities; even the small boys beg, borrow,
or steal a goat-bell and attach it to the hinder part of their
person in lieu of a tail, or, at the worst, make good the caudal
deficiency with a branch from the nearest tree.</p>

<p>Thus in various grades of goat-like attire the young men and
boys traverse the town, stopping here and there, where the steep
and tortuous paths offer a wider and more level space, to leap and
dance, or anon at some friendly door to imbibe spirituous encouragement
to further efforts. In the dancing itself there is nothing
peculiar to this festival; the swinging amble, which is the gait
of the more heavily equipped, is prescribed by the burden of bells
and the roughness of roads. The purpose of the leaping and
dancing is solely to evoke as much din as possible from the bells;
and prodigious indeed is the jarring and jangling in those
narrow alleys when the troupe of dancers leap together into
the air, as high as their burdens allow, and come down with
one crash.</p>

<p>Since I first published<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> an account of these festivities in
Scyros, similar celebrations of carnival-time have been reported
from other places; at Sochos in Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> the scene is almost
identical with that which I have described; in the district of Viza
in Thrace a primitive dramatic performance was recently observed
in which the two chief actors wore similar goat-skins, masks, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
bells, and had their hands blackened<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>; and again at Kostí in the
extreme north of Thrace there is mummery of the same kind<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.</p>

<p>A scene of the same sort was formerly enacted in Athens also
during the carnival, and was known by the expressive name <span class="greek">τὰ
ταράματα</span> (i.e. <span class="greek">ταράγματα</span>), ‘The Riotings.’ A man dressed up as a
bear used to rush through the streets followed by a crowd of youths
howling and clashing any noisy instruments that came to hand.
That this ceremony was originally of a religious character is
shown not only by its association with the season of Lent, but
by an accessory rite performed on the same occasion. Wooden
statues, actually called <span class="greek">ξόανα</span> as late as the time of the Greek
War of Independence, were carried out in procession; and the
well-being of the people was believed to be so bound up with the
due performance of these rites, that even during the Revolution,
when Athens was in the hands of the Turks, a native of the place
is said to have returned from Aegina, whither he had fled for
safety, in order to play the part of the bear and to carry out the
<i>xoana</i> for the general good<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>.</p>

<p>The close connexion of these several modern customs, whether
the occasion of them is the Twelve Days or Carnival-time, cannot
be doubted. The variation of date is of old standing; for the
canon of the Church, on which Balsamon<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> comments, condemns
certain pagan festivals on March 1st (approximately the carnival
time) along with the <i>Kalandae</i> and <i>Brumalia</i>; and the similarity
of the dresses, masks, bells, and other accoutrements proper to both
occasions proves the substantial identity of the festivals.</p>

<p>A comparison of these allied modern customs can only lead
to one conclusion. The use of the same word to denote the
mummers in Crete and the Callicantzari in Achaia; the name
<span class="greek">ῥουκατζιάρια</span> for these mummers at Palaeogratsana; the custom of
blackening the face, which is clearly indicated by the employment
of the name ‘Arab’ in this connexion; the monstrous and half-animal
appearance produced by masks, foxes’ brushes, goat-skins,
and suchlike adornments; the attempted rape of the bride by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
‘Arab’ in the play at Pharsala&mdash;all furnish contributory evidence
that the mummers themselves represent Callicantzari. Only at
Portariá is the significance of the custom somewhat confused;
there the ‘Arab’ in his old cloak and bells has long ceased to
represent a Callicantzaros, and has actually been provided with a
lantern with which to scare the Callicantzari away.</p>

<p>The mummers then represent Callicantzari; the question
which remains to be answered is whether the mumming was the
cause or the effect of the belief in Callicantzari.</p>

<p>Polites, in support of his theory that the name Callicantzari,
in its earliest form, meant either ‘wearers of nice boots’ or
‘possessors of hoofs instead of boots,’ claims that the mummers
first suggested to the Greek imagination the conception of the
Callicantzari (it is not indeed anywhere mentioned in the above
traditions that the feet or the footgear of the mummers were in
any way remarkable, but we may let that pass), and that the fear
which their riotous conduct inspired in earlier times gradually
elevated them in men’s minds to the rank of demons. This, he
urges, is the reason why these demons are feared only during the
Twelve Days, the period when such mumming was in vogue.</p>

<p>In confirmation of his view Polites cites some of the evidence
concerning the human origin of the Callicantzari, mentioning both
the fairly common belief that men turn into Callicantzari, and the
rarer traditions that a Callicantzaros resumes his human shape if
a torch be thrust in his face and that the transformation of men
into Callicantzari can be prevented by certain means. With this
evidence I have already dealt, and I agree with Polites that in it
there survives a genuine record of the human origin of the Callicantzari.
But of course on the further question, whether the
particular men thus elevated to the dignity of demons were the
mummers of Christmastide, it has no immediate bearing.</p>

<p>As a second piece of corroboration, he adduces another derivation
hardly more felicitous than those with which I have already dealt.
The word on which he tries his hand this time is <span class="greek">καμπουχέροι</span> or
<span class="greek">κατσιμπουχέροι</span>&mdash;the name of the mummers in Crete and of the
Callicantzari in Achaia. Here again, with a certain perversity, he
selects the worse form of the two, <span class="greek">καμπουχέροι</span>, which is evidently
a syncopated form of the other, and proceeds to derive it from the
Spanish <i>gambujo</i>, ‘a mask,’ leaving the subsequent development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
of <span class="greek">κατσιμπουχέροι</span> totally inexplicable. For my own part I consider
it far more probable that the word <span class="greek">κατσιμπουχέροι</span> is a
humorously compounded name, of which the second half is the
word <span class="greek">μπουχαρί</span><a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> (an Arabic word which has passed, probably
through Turkish, into Greek) meaning ‘chimney,’ and that the
whole by-name has reference simply to the common belief that
Callicantzari try to extinguish the fire on the hearth and thus to
gain access to the house by the chimney. As to the meaning of
<span class="greek">κατσι-</span>, the first half of the compound, I can only hazard the
conjecture that it is connected with the verb <span class="greek">κατσιάζω</span>, which
ordinarily means to blight, to wither, to dry up, and so forth,
though its passive participle, <span class="greek">κατσιασμένος</span>, is said by Skarlatos<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>
to be applied to clothes which are ‘difficult to wash.’ If then the
compound <span class="greek">κατσιμπουχέροι</span> is a descriptive title of the Callicantzari,
meaning those who render the chimney difficult to wash,
the coarse and eminently rustic humour of the allusion to their
habits needs no further explanation; and it is the mummers
of Crete who owe their name to the Callicantzari, not <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<p>While therefore I acknowledge and appreciate to the full the
value of Polites’ researches into the history of the Twelve Days,
the inferences which he draws from the material collected seem to
me no more sound than the derivations which they are designed
to corroborate. My own interpretation of the historical facts which
Polites has brought together is as follows.</p>

<p>The superstitions and customs connected by the modern folk
with the Twelve Days are undoubtedly an inheritance from
ancestors who celebrated the Brumalia and other pagan festivals
at the same season of the year. These ancient festivals, though
Roman in name, probably differed very little in the manner of
their observance from certain old Greek festivals, chief among which
was some festival of Dionysus. This is rendered probable both by
the date of these festivals and by the manner of their celebration.
For the worship of Dionysus was practically confined to the winter-time;
at Delphi his cult superseded that of Apollo during the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
winter months<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>; and at Athens the four festivals of Dionysus fell
within about the same period&mdash;the rural Dionysia at the end of
November or beginning of December, the Lenaea about a month
later, the Anthesteria at the end of January, and the Great Dionysia
at the end of February. As for the manner of conducting the
Latin-named festivals, Asterios’ description of the Kalándae in
the fifth century plainly attests the Dionysiac character of the
orgies, and Balsamon, in the twelfth, was so convinced, from what
he himself witnessed, of their Bacchanalian origin, that he actually
proposed to derive the name <i>Brumalia</i> from <span class="greek">Βροῦμος</span><a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> (by which
he meant <span class="greek">Βρόμιος</span>) a surname of Dionysus.</p>

<p>The mumming then, which is still customary in some parts
of Greece during the Twelve Days, is a survival apparently of
festivals in honour of Dionysus. Further the mummers dress
themselves up to resemble Callicantzari. But the worship of
Dionysus presented a similar scene; ‘those who made processions
in honour of Dionysus,’ says Ulpian, ‘used to dress
themselves up for that purpose to resemble his companions, some
in the guise of Satyrs, others as Bacchae, and others as Sileni<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.’
The mummers therefore of the present day have, it appears,
inherited the custom of dressing up from the ancient worshippers
of Dionysus and are their modern representatives; and from
this it follows that the Callicantzari whom the modern mummers
strive to resemble are to be identified with those motley companions
of Dionysus whom his worshippers imitated of old.</p>

<p>The more closely these two identifications are examined, the
more certain they will appear. Take for example Müller’s general
description<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> of the celebration of Dionysus’ festivals. ‘The swarm
of subordinate beings&mdash;Satyrs, Panes, and Nymphs&mdash;by whom
Bacchus was surrounded, and through whom life seemed to pass
from the god of outward nature into vegetation and the animal
world, and branch off into a variety of beautiful or grotesque
forms, were ever present to the fancy of the Greeks; it was not
necessary to depart very widely from the ordinary course of
ideas, to imagine that dances of fair nymphs and bold satyrs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
among the solitary woods and rocks, were visible to human
eyes, or even in fancy to take a part in them. The intense
desire felt by every worshipper of Bacchus to fight, to conquer,
to suffer, in common with him, made them regard these subordinate
beings as a convenient step by which they could approach
more nearly to the presence of their divinity. The custom, so
prevalent at the festivals of Bacchus, of taking the disguise of
satyrs, doubtless originated in this feeling, and not in the mere
desire of concealing excesses under the disguise of a mask;
otherwise, so serious and pathetic a spectacle as tragedy could
never have originated in the choruses of these satyrs. The
desire of escaping from <i>self</i> into something new and strange,
of living in an imaginary world, breaks forth in a thousand
instances in these festivals of Bacchus. It is seen in the colouring
the body with plaster, soot, vermilion, and different sorts of
green and red juices of plants, wearing goats’ and deer skins round
the loins, covering the face with large leaves of different plants;
and lastly in the wearing masks of wood, bark, and other materials,
and of a complete costume belonging to the character.’ To
complete this description it may be added that ‘drunkenness,
and the boisterous music of flutes, cymbals and drums, were
likewise common to all Dionysiac festivals<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>.’ Which of all these
things is missing in the mediaeval or modern counterpart of the
festival? The blackening of the face or the wearing of the masks,
the feminine costume or beast-like disguise, the boisterous music
of bells, the rioting and drunkenness&mdash;all are reproduced in the
celebration of Kalandae and Brumalia or in the mumming of the
Twelve Days. The mummers are the worshippers of a god, whose
name however and existence they and their forefathers have long
forgotten.</p>

<p>And again are not the Callicantzari faithful reproductions of
the Satyrs and Sileni who ever attended Dionysus? Their semi-bestial
form with legs of goat or ass affixed to a human trunk,
their grotesque faces and goat-like ears and horns, their boisterous
and mischievous merriment, their love of wine, their passion for
dancing, above all in company with Nereids, the indecency of
their actions and sometimes of their appearance, their wantonness
and lust&mdash;all these widely acknowledged attributes of the Calli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>cantzari
proclaim them lineal descendants of Dionysus’ motley
comrades.</p>

<p>Such is my interpretation of the facts collected by Polites,
and it differs from that which he has advanced in the reversal
of cause and effect. Starting from the fact that dressing up in
various disguises was the chief characteristic of the Kalandae and
Brumalia and is perpetuated in the mumming of the Twelve
Days, but failing to carry his researches far enough back and so
to discover the absolute identity of these festivals with the ancient
Dionysia, he holds that the generally prevalent custom of dressing
up in monstrous and horrible disguises at a given period of the
year&mdash;a custom which he leaves unexplained&mdash;was the cause of
the belief in the activity of monstrous and horrible demons at
that period; those who had once been simply human mummers
were exalted to the ranks of the supernatural, but still betrayed
their origin by the possession of a name which meant either
‘wearers of nice boots’ or else ‘hoofed and not booted.’ In my
view on the contrary the identity of the modern mumming with
the ancient Dionysia is indisputable; and just as in ancient times
the belief in the Satyrs and Sileni was the cause of the adoption
of satyr-like disguises in the Dionysia, so in more recent times,
when the Satyrs, Sileni, and others came to be included in the
more comprehensive term Callicantzari, it was the belief in the
Callicantzari which continued to cause the wearing of similar
disguises during the Twelve Days.</p>

<p>And this interpretation of the facts explains no less adequately
than that of Polites the reason why the activities of the Callicantzari
are limited to the Twelve Days. That which was in
ancient times the special season for the commemoration of Dionysus
and his attendants has now with the very gradual but still real
decline of ancient beliefs become the only season. This is natural
and intelligible enough in itself; but, if a parallel be required,
Greek folklore can provide one. No one will suppose that the
Dryads of ancient Greece were feared during the first six days
of August only, though it is likely enough that they had a special
festival at that time; but in modern folklore these are the only
days on which, in many parts of Greece, any survival of the
Dryads’ memory can be found<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>
<p>Moreover the identification of the Callicantzari with the
Satyrs and other kindred comrades of Dionysus elucidates a
modern custom which I noticed earlier in this chapter but did
not then explain&mdash;the rare, but known, custom of making
offerings to the Callicantzari. The sweetmeats, waffles, sausages,
and even the pig’s bone which are occasionally placed in the
chimney for the Callicantzari correspond, it would seem, with
offerings formerly made to Dionysus and shared by his train of
Satyrs. Possibly even the choice of pork (usually in the shape
of sausages) or, in the more rudimentary form of the survival, of
a pig’s bone, dates from the age in which the proper victim for
Dionysus at the Anthesteria was a sow; but of course it may only
have been determined by the fact that pork is the peasant’s
Christmas fare and therefore the most ready offering at that
season.</p>

<p>How then, it will be asked, does the conclusion here reached,
namely that the Callicantzari are, in many districts, the modern
representatives of the Satyrs and other kindred beings, square
with that other conclusion previously drawn from another set of
facts, namely that the Callicantzari were originally not demons
but men who either voluntarily or under the compulsion of a
kind of madness assumed the shape and the character of beasts?
The reconciliation of these two apparently antagonistic conclusions
depends primarily on the derivation of the name Callicantzari.</p>

<p>Now the conditions which in my opinion that derivation
should satisfy, have already been indicated in my discussion of
dialectic forms and in my criticism of the several derivations
proposed by others; but it will be well to summarise them here.
They are four in number.</p>

<p>First, the derivation of this word, as of all others, must involve
only such phonetic changes as find parallels in other words of the
language.</p>

<p>Secondly, it must recognise the commonest form <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>
as being also the central and original form from which the
many dialectic forms in the above table have diverged.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it must explain this form as a compound of a word
<span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>&mdash;presumably with <span class="greek">καλός</span>. For, in dialect, there exists
a word <span class="greek">σκατζάρι</span>, which is used as a synonym with <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>
and is evidently in form a diminutive of the word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
<span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>, and likewise there exists another synonym <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span>,
which cannot be formed from <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span> by an
arbitrary shuffling of syllables but is a separate compound of
<span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>&mdash;presumably with <span class="greek">λύκος</span>.</p>

<p>Fourthly, and consequently on the last-named condition, the
word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>, whether alone or in composition with either
<span class="greek">καλός</span> or <span class="greek">λύκος</span>, must possess a meaning adequate to denote the
monsters who have been described.</p>

<p>All these conditions are satisfied in the identification of the
word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> with the ancient word <span class="greek">κένταυρος</span>.</p>

<p>The phonetic change herein involved will, to any who are not
familiar with the pronunciation of modern Greek, appear more
considerable than it really is. In that pronunciation it must be
remembered that the accent, which indicates the syllable on which
stress is laid, is everything, and ancient quantity is nothing; and
further that the ancient diphthongs <i>au</i> and <i>eu</i> have come to be
pronounced respectively as <i>av</i> or <i>af</i> and <i>ev</i> or <i>ef</i>. The change of
sound in this case may therefore be fairly measured by the difference
between kéndăvrŏs and kándzărŏs in British pronunciation<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>.
The phonetic modifications therefore which require notice are the
substitution of <span class="greek">α</span> for <span class="greek">ε</span> in the first syllable, the introduction of a
<span class="greek">ζ</span> after the <span class="greek">τ</span>, and the loss of the <i>v</i>-sound before the <span class="greek">ρ</span>.</p>

<p>The change from <span class="greek">ε</span> to <span class="greek">α</span> is very common in Greek, especially
(by assimilation it would seem) where the following syllable, as
in the word before us, has an <span class="greek">α</span> for its vowel. Thus <span class="greek">ἀλαφρός</span>
is constantly to be heard instead of <span class="greek">ἐλαφρός</span> (light), <span class="greek">ἀργαλει̯ός</span> for
<span class="greek">ἐργαλειός</span> (a loom), <span class="greek">ματα-</span> for <span class="greek">μετα-</span> in compound verbs. The
insertion of <span class="greek">ζ</span> (or <span class="greek">σ</span>) after <span class="greek">τ</span> is certainly a less common change, but
parallels can be found for this also. The ancient word <span class="greek">τέττιγες</span>
(grasshoppers) appears in modern Greek as <span class="greek">τζίτζικες</span>. A word of
Latin origin<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> <span class="greek">τεντόνω</span> (I stretch) has an equally common by-form
<span class="greek">τσιτόνω</span>. The classical word <span class="greek">τύκανον</span> (a chisel) has passed,
through a diminutive form <span class="greek">τυκάνιον</span>, into the modern <span class="greek">τσουκάνι</span>.
The word <span class="greek">κεντήματα</span> (embroideries) has a dialectic form <span class="greek">κεντζήματα</span><a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.
From the adjective <span class="greek">μουντός</span> (grey, brown, dusky) are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
formed substantives <span class="greek">μουντζοῦρα</span> and <span class="greek">μουντζαλι̯ά</span> (a stain or daub).
The substantive <span class="greek">κατσοῦφα</span> (sulkiness, sullenness) is probably to
be identified with the ancient <span class="greek">κατήφεια</span>. The two most frequently
employed equivalents for ‘mad’ or ‘crazy’&mdash;<span class="greek">τρελλός</span> and <span class="greek">ζουρλός</span>&mdash;are
probably of kindred origin&mdash;an insertion of <span class="greek">ζ</span> in the former
having produced first <span class="greek">τζερλός</span> and thence <span class="greek">(τ)ζουρλός</span>. Finally
there is some likelihood that the word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>, in a botanical
sense in which it is now used, is to be identified with the ancient
plant-name <span class="greek">κενταυρεῖον</span> or <span class="greek">κενταύριον</span>. The former indeed now
denotes a kind of juniper, while the later is of course our ‘centaury’;
but this difference in meaning is not, I think, fatal to the
identification of the words. At the present day the common-folk
are extraordinarily vague in their nomenclature of natural objects.
In travelling about I made a practice of asking my guides and
others the names of flowers and birds and suchlike; and my
general experience might fairly be summed up by saying that the
average peasant divides all birds which he does not eat into two
classes; the larger ones are hawks, and the smaller are&mdash;‘little
birds, God knows what’; and an accompanying shrug of the
shoulders indicates that the man does not care; while most flowers
can be called either violets or gilly-flowers at pleasure. Even
therefore when a peasant of superior intelligence knows that
<span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> is now the name of a kind of juniper, it does not follow
that that name has always belonged to it, and has not been
transferred to it from some plant formerly used, let us say, for
a like purpose. In this case it is known that both juniper and
some kind of centaury were formerly used for medicating wine<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>,
and the wine treated with either was prescribed as ‘good for the
stomach<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>.’ Hence a confusion of the two plants is intelligible
enough among a peasantry not distinguished by a love of
botanical accuracy. But I place no reliance upon this possible
identification; the cases previously cited furnish sufficient
analogies.</p>

<p>Further it may be noted that in the first two examples of this
insertion of <span class="greek">ζ</span> or <span class="greek">σ</span> a certain change in the consonants of the next
syllable accompanies it. The <span class="greek">γ</span> in <span class="greek">τέττιγες</span> becomes <span class="greek">κ</span>, the <span class="greek">ντ</span> in
<span class="greek">τεντόνω</span> is reduced to <span class="greek">τ</span>. In the same way, it seems, when <span class="greek">ζ</span> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
inserted after the <span class="greek">τ</span> of <span class="greek">κένταυρος</span>, the sound of <i>vr</i> was reduced to
<i>r</i> only, though certainly the loss of the <i>v</i>-sound might have
occurred, apart from any such predisposing modification, as in
the common word <span class="greek">ξέρω</span> (I know) for <span class="greek">ἠξεύρω</span>.</p>

<p>Since then the etymological conditions of the problem are
satisfied by the identification of the word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> with the
ancient <span class="greek">κένταυρος</span>, it remains only to show that the name of
‘Centaurs’ fitly belongs to the monsters whom I have described;
and my contention will be that the simple word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>,
‘Centaur,’ surviving now only in the dialectic diminutive form
<span class="greek">σκατζάρι</span>, adequately expresses every sort and condition of Callicantzaros
that has been depicted; that <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>, the
general word, of which so many dialectic varieties occur, being
simply an euphemistic compound of <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> with <span class="greek">καλός</span> such as
we have previously seen in the title <span class="greek">καλλικυρᾶδες</span> given to the
Nereids, expresses precisely the same meaning as the simple
word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span>, ‘Centaur’; and that <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span> originally
denoted one species only of the genus Centaur, namely a Callicantzaros
whose animal traits were those of a wolf.</p>

<p>What then did the ancients mean by the word ‘centaur’?</p>

<p>The mention of the name is apt to carry away our minds to
famous frieze or pediment, where in one splendidly impossible
creation of art the excellences of man, his head and his hands,
are wed with the horse’s strength and speed. This was the species
of Centaur which the great sculptors and painters in the best
period of Greek Art chose to depict, and these among educated
men became the Centaurs <i>par excellence</i>. Yet even so it was not
forgotten that they formed only one species, and were strictly to
be called <span class="greek">ἱπποκένταυροι</span>, ‘horse-centaurs.’ Moreover two other
species of Centaur are named in the ancient language, <span class="greek">ἰχθυοκένταυροι</span>
or fish-centaurs, and <span class="greek">ὀνοκένταυροι</span> or ass-centaurs. Of
the former nothing seems to be known beyond the mere name,
but this matters little inasmuch as they can assuredly have
contributed nothing to the popular conception of the wholly
terrestrial Callicantzari. The ass-centaurs will prove of more
interest.</p>

<p>But the list of ancient species of Centaur does not really
stop here. No other compounds of the word Centaur may exist,
but none the less there were other Centaurs&mdash;other creatures, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
is, of mixed human and animal form. Chief among these were the
Satyrs, who as pourtrayed by early Greek art might equally well
have been called ‘hippocentaurs,’ and in the presentations of Greco-Roman
art deserved the name, if I may coin it, of ‘tragocentaurs.’
And the Greeks themselves recognised this fact. ‘The evidence of
the coins of Macedonia,’ says Miss Jane Harrison<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>, ‘is instructive.
On the coins of Orreskii, a centaur, a horse-man, bears off a woman
in his arms. At Lete close at hand, with a coinage closely
resembling in style, fabric, weight the money of the Orreskii and
other Pangaean tribes, the type is the same in <i>content</i>, though
with an instructive difference of form&mdash;a naked Satyr or Seilenos
with the hooves, ears and tail of a horse seizes a woman round
the waist.... This interchange of types, Satyr and Centaur, is
evidence about which there can be no mistake. Satyr and
Centaur, slightly diverse types of the horse-man, are in essence
one and the same.’ Nor was the recognition of this fact confined
to Macedonia. A famous picture by Zeuxis, representing the
domestic life of Centaurs, with a female Centaur (a creature
about as rare as a female Callicantzaros) suckling her young,
pourtrayed her in most respects, apart from her sex, conventionally,
but gave her the ears of a Satyr<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>. And reversely Nonnus
ventured to describe the ‘shaggy Satyrs’ as being, ‘by blood, of
Centaur-stock<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>.’ In view then of this close bond between the
two types of half-human half-animal creatures, it would be
natural that, when the specific name Satyr was lost, as it has
been lost, from the popular language, while the generic term
Centaur survived in the form Callicantzaros, the Satyrs should
have been amalgamated with those who from of old had professed
and called themselves Centaurs; and with the Satyrs, I suppose,
went also the Sileni.</p>

<p>Thus the word Centaur, in spite of the narrowing tendencies
of Greek art which selected the hippocentaur as the ideal type,
was always comprehensive in popular use, and perhaps became
even wider in scope as time went on and the distinctive appellations
of Satyrs and suchlike were forgotten; but it is also
possible that from the very earliest times the distinction between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Satyrs and Centaurs was merely an artistic and literary convention,
and that in popular speech the name Centaur was
applied to both without discrimination. But it does not really
concern us to argue at length the question whether the common-folk
in antiquity never distinguished, or, having once distinguished,
subsequently confused the Satyrs and the Centaurs. It is just
worth noticing that it was in art of the Greco-Roman period, so
far as I can discover, that horse-centaurs first began to be represented
along with Satyrs and Sileni in the <i>entourage</i> of Dionysus;
and if this addition to the conventional treatment of such scenes
was made, as seems likely, in deference to popular beliefs, the
date by which the close association of the two classes was an
accomplished fact and confusion of them therefore likely to ensue
is approximately determined.</p>

<p>At some date therefore probably not later than the beginning
of our era, the generic name of Centaur comprised several species
of half-human, half-animal monsters, of whom the best known
were horse-centaurs, ass-centaurs, Satyrs, and Sileni; and each of
these species, it will be seen, has contributed something to one or
other of the many types of the modern Centaurs, the Callicantzari.</p>

<p>The horse-centaur, which was the favourite species among the
artists of ancient times, has curiously enough had least influence
upon the modern delineation of Callicantzari. The only attribute
which they seem to have received chiefly from this source is the
rough shaggy hair with which they are usually said to be covered;
‘shaggy’ is Homer’s epithet for the Centaurs<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>, and the hippocentaurs
of later art retained the trait; for it is specially noted by
Lucian that in Zeuxis’ picture the male hippocentaur was shaggy
all over, the human part of him no less than the equine<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>.</p>

<p>The ass-centaur on the contrary is rarely mentioned by
ancient writers, but has contributed largely to some presentments
of the Callicantzari. Aelian mentions the name, in the feminine
form <span class="greek">ὀνοκενταύρα</span>, but the monster to which he applies it, although
true to its name in that the upper part of its body is human and
the lower part asinine, is not a creation of superstitious fancy, but,
as is evident from other facts which he mentions, some species of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
ape known to him, none too accurately, from some traveller’s
tale. The <i>locus classicus</i> on the subject of genuine supernatural
ass-centaurs is a passage in the Septuagint translation of Isaiah<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>:
<span class="greek">καὶ συναντήσουσιν δαιμόνια ὀνοκενταύροις καὶ βοηθήσονται ἕτερος
πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται ὀνοκένταυροι εὑρόντες αὑτοῖς
ἀνάπαυσιν</span>&mdash;‘And demons shall meet with ass-centaurs and they
shall bring help one to another; there shall ass-centaurs find rest
for themselves and be at rest.’ Here our Revised Version runs:&mdash;“The
wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves (<i>Heb.</i>
‘howling creatures’), and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea,
the night-monster shall settle there.” The comparison is instructive.
It is clear from the context that the Septuagint
translators were minded to give some Greek colouring to their
rendering even at the expense of strict accuracy; for in the previous
verse, where our Revised Version employs the word ‘jackals,’ the
Septuagint introduces beings whose voices are generally supposed
to have been more attractive, the Sirens. The use of the word
‘ass-centaurs’ cannot therefore have been prompted by any
pedantic notions of literal translation. The creatures, for all the
lack of other literary warranty, must have been familiar to the
popular imagination. And what may be gleaned from the passage
concerning their character? Apparently they are the nearest
Greek equivalent for ‘howling creatures’ and for ‘night-monsters’;
and such emphasis in the Greek is laid upon the statement that
they will ‘find rest for themselves and be at rest,’ that they must
surely in general have borne a character for restlessness. These
restless noisy monsters of the night, in shape half-human and half-asinine,
are clearly in character no less than in form the prototypes
of some modern Callicantzari.</p>

<p>Of the many traits inherited by the Callicantzari from the
Satyrs and Sileni, the usual comrades of Dionysus, I have already
spoken. So far as outward appearance is concerned, the Satyrs as
they came to be pourtrayed in the later Greek art are clearly
responsible for the goat-type so common in the description of the
Callicantzari, while a reminiscence of the Sileni may perhaps be
traced in the rarer bald-headed type. But as regards their manner
of life, which as I have shown bears many resemblances to that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
the Satyrs&mdash;their boisterous merriment and rioting, their love of
wine, their violence, and their lewdness&mdash;these traits cannot of
course be referred to the Satyrs any more than to the hippocentaurs
or for that matter to the onocentaurs who were probably
no more sober or chaste than their kindred. Rather it was the
common possession of these qualities by the several types of half-human
and half-bestial monsters that allowed them to be grouped
together under the single name of Callicantzari.</p>

<p>Thus the conclusion drawn from an historical survey of those
ancient festivals which are now represented by the Twelve Days,
namely that the Callicantzari are the modern representatives of
Dionysus’ monstrous comrades, is both corroborated and amplified
by the etymological identification of the Callicantzari (or in the
simple and unadorned form, the <span class="greek">σκατζάρια</span>) with the Centaurs, of
whom the Satyrs and the Sileni are species.</p>

<p>The remaining modern name on which I have to touch readily
explains itself in the light of what has already been said. If the
word <span class="greek">κάντζαρος</span> is the modern form of <span class="greek">κένταυρος</span>, and if by the
name ‘Centaur’ was denoted a being half-human and half-animal
both in shape and in character, then the name <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span>
clearly should mean a creature half-man half-wolf, such as the
ancients might have called a lycocentaur, but did actually
name <span class="greek">λυκάνθρωπος</span>. Lycocantzaros then etymologically should
mean the werewolf&mdash;a man transformed either by his own power
or by some external influence into a wolf.</p>

<p>The idea of lycanthropy has probably been familiar to the
peasants of Greece continuously from the earliest ages down to
the present day, either surviving traditionally like so many other
beliefs, or possibly stimulated by actual experiences; for lycanthropy
is not a mere figment of the imagination, but is a very
real and terrible form of madness, under the influence of which
the sufferer believes himself transformed (and by dress or lack of
it tries to transfigure himself) into a wolf or other wild animal,
and in that state develops and satisfies a craving for human flesh.
Outbreaks of it were terribly frequent in the east of Europe during
the Middle Ages, especially among the Slavonic populations; and
it is not likely that Greece wholly escaped this scourge. But
whether the idea received some such impetus or no, it was
certainly known to the ancient Greeks, and is not wholly forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
at the present day. This was curiously betrayed by some questions
put to an American archaeologist by an Arcadian peasant. Among
the items of falsehood vended as news by the Greek press he had
seen, but owing to the would-be classical style had failed to understand,
certain allegations concerning the cannibalistic habits of Red
Indians; and the points on which he sought enlightenment were,
first, whether they ran on all fours, and, secondly, whether they
went naked or wore wolf-skins. In effect the only form of savagery
familiar to his mind was that of the werewolf.</p>

<p>Now here, it might be thought, is the clue by which to explain
the first conclusion which we reached, namely, that the Callicantzari
were originally men capable of transformation into beasts.
The name <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span> or werewolf, it might be urged, involved
the idea of such transformation; and the idea originally associated
with the one species was extended to the whole tribe of Callicantzari.
At first sight such an explanation is attractive and
appears tenable; but maturer consideration compels me to reject it.</p>

<p>In the first place, although the word <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span> cannot
etymologically have meant anything but werewolf when it was
first employed, at the present day in the few districts where the
name may be heard, in Cynouria, in Messenia, and, so far as
I can ascertain, in Crete, it involves no idea of the transformation
of men into beasts; it is merely a variant form for <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span>
and in no way distinguished from it in meaning, and the Callicantzari
in those districts are demons of definite hybrid form, not
men temporarily transformed into beasts. And conversely in the
Cyclades and other places where the belief in this transformation
of men is prevalent, the compound <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span> seems to be
unknown, and <span class="greek">καλλικάντζαρος</span> (or some dialectic form of the same
word) is in vogue. Since then in many places where the generic
name Callicantzari is alone in use, the human origin of these
monsters is maintained, while in those few districts where the
specific name Lycocantzari is also used that human origin is
denied, it is hard to believe that in this respect the surviving
ideas concerning the genus can be the outcome of obsolete ideas
concerning the species.</p>

<p>Secondly, if for the sake of argument it be granted that the
Callicantzari had always been demons, how came the werewolf, the
<span class="greek">λυκάνθρωπος</span>, whose very name proved him half-human, to change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that name to <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span>? How came a man who occasionally
turned into a wolf to be classified as one species in a genus of beings
who <i>ex hypothesi</i> were not human even in origin, but demoniacal?
We should have to suppose that the peasants of that epoch in
which the change of name occurred did not distinguish between
men and demons&mdash;which, as Euclid puts it, is absurd; wherefore
the supposition that the Callicantzari had always been regarded as
demons until werewolves were admitted to their ranks cannot
be maintained. Rather the point of resemblance between the
earliest Callicantzari and werewolves, which made the amalgamation
of them possible, must have been the belief that both alike
were men transformed into animals.</p>

<p>Since then the belief in the metamorphosis of men into Callicantzari
existed before that epoch&mdash;a quite indeterminate epoch,
I am afraid&mdash;in which the word <span class="greek">λυκάνθρωπος</span> fell into desuetude<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
and was replaced by <span class="greek">λυκοκάντζαρος</span>, where are we to look for the
origin of the idea?</p>

<p>Since the Callicantzari bear the name of the Centaurs, it is
obvious that the enquiry must be carried yet further back, and
that the ancient ideas concerning the Centaurs’ origin must be
investigated. Pindar touches often upon the Centaur-myths;
what view did he take of the Centaurs’ nature? Were they
divine in origin or human? We shall see that he held no settled
view on the subject. Both traditions concerning the origin of the
Centaurs were familiar to him just as both traditions still prevail
in modern accounts of the Callicantzari; sometimes he follows
the one, sometimes the other. On the one hand the Centaur
Chiron is consistently described as divine. ‘Fain would I,’ says
Pindar<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>, ‘that Chiron ... wide-ruling scion of Cronos the son of
Ouranos were living and not gone, and that the Beast of the wilds
were ruling o’er the glens of Pelion’; and again he names him
‘Chiron son of Cronos<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>’ and ‘the Beast divine<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.’ In Pindar’s view
Chiron, be he Beast or God, is certainly not human; and if he is
once named by the same poet ‘the Magnesian Centaur<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>,’ the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
epithet need only perhaps declare his habitation. His divinity is
plainly asserted, and the legend that he resigned the divine
guerdon of immortality in order to deliver Prometheus accords
with Pindar’s doctrine.</p>

<p>But on the other hand the story of Ixion as told by Pindar
reveals another tradition. Ixion himself was human; for his presumptuous
sin of lusting after the wife of Zeus ‘swiftly he suffered
as he, mere man, deserved, and won a misery unique<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>.’ The son of
Ixion therefore by a nebulous mother could not be divine. The
cloud wherewith in his delusion he had mated ‘bare unto him,
unblest of the Graces, a monstrous son, a thing apart even as she,
with no rank either among men or where gods have their portion;
him she nurtured and named Centauros; and he in the dales of
Pelion did mate with Magnesian mares, and thence there sprang
a wondrous warrior-tribe like unto both their parents&mdash;like to
their dams in their nether parts, and the upper frame their sire’s<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>.’
The first Centaur then, the founder of the race, though only half-human
in origin, was in no respect divine. How then came
Chiron, one of that race, to be divine? The two traditions are
inconsistent. Pindar as a poet was not troubled thereby; he
chose now the one, now the other, for his art to embroider. But
in the science of mythology the discrepancy of the two traditions
is important. Once more we must carry our search further back&mdash;to
Hesiod and to Homer.</p>

<p>The former, in placing the battle of the Lapithae and the
Centaurs among the scenes wrought on the shield of Heracles<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>,
says never a word to suggest that either set of combatants were
other than human; the contrast between them lies wholly in the
weapons they use. The Lapithae have their leaders enumerated,
Caineus, Dryas, Pirithous, and the rest; the Centaurs in like
manner are gathered about their Chieftains, ‘huge Petraeos and
Asbolos the augur and Arctos and Oureios and black-haired Mimas
and the two sons of Peukeus, Perimedes and Dryalos.’ The
account reads like a description of a fight between two tribes, one
of them equipped with body-armour and using spears, the other
more primitive and armed only with rude wooden weapons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span></p>

<p>To this representation of the Centaurs Homer also, in the
<i>Iliad</i>, consents; for, though he names them Pheres or ‘Beasts,’ it
is quite clear that this is the proper name of a tribe of men&mdash;men
who dwelt on Mount Pelion and were hardly less valiant than the
heroes who conquered them. ‘Never saw I,’ says Nestor, ‘nor
shall see other such men as were Pirithous and Dryas, shepherd
of hosts, and Caineus and Exadios and godlike Polyphemus
and Theseus, son of Aegeus, like unto the immortals. Mightiest
in sooth were they of men upon the earth, and against mightiest
fought, even the mountain-haunting Pheres, and fearfully they
did destroy them<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>.’ And again we hear how Pirithous ‘took
vengeance on the shaggy Pheres, and drave them forth from
Pelion to dwell nigh unto the Aethices<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>.’ Apart from the name
‘Pheres,’ which will shortly be examined, there is nothing in these
passages any more than in that of Hesiod to suggest that the
conflict of the Lapithae and the Centaurs means anything but the
destruction or expulsion of a primitive and wild mountain-tribe by
a people who, in the wearing of body-armour, had advanced one
important step in material civilisation. Yet in some respects the
tribe of Centaurs were, according to Homer, at least the equals of
their neighbours; for Chiron, ‘the justest of the Centaurs<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>,’ was
the teacher both of the greatest warrior, Achilles<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>, and of the
greatest physician, Asclepios<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>. The only passage of Homer which
has been held to imply that the Centaurs were not men comes not
from the <i>Iliad</i> but from the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>&mdash;<span class="greek">ἐξ οὗ Κενταύροισι καὶ
ἀνδράσι νεῖκος ἐτύχθη</span>&mdash;which Miss Harrison<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> translates ‘Thence
’gan the feud ’twixt Centaurs and mankind,’ inferring therefrom
the non-humanity of the Centaurs. It is however legitimate to
take the word <span class="greek">ἀνδράσι</span> in a stricter sense, and to render the line,
‘Thence arose the feud between Centaurs and heroes,’ to wit, the
heroes Pirithous, Dryas, and others; and the inference is then
impaired. But in any case the <i>Iliad</i>, the earlier authority,
consistently depicts both Chiron and the other Centaurs as human.
The tradition of a divine origin must have arisen between the
date of the <i>Iliad</i> and the time of Pindar, and from then until now
popular opinion must have been divided on the question whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the Centaurs, the Callicantzari, were properly men or demons.
But one part of the conclusion at which we first arrived, namely
that Callicantzari were originally men, is justified by Homer’s
and Hesiod’s testimony.</p>

<p>What then of the other part of that conclusion? There is
ancient proof that the Callicantzari were originally men; but
what witness is there to the metamorphosis of those men into
beasts? The Centaurs’ alternative name, Pheres.</p>

<p>An ethnological explanation of this name has recently been
put forward by Prof. Ridgeway<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>. Concluding from the evidence of
the <i>Iliad</i> that ‘the Pheres are as yet nothing more than a
mountain tribe and are not yet conceived as half-horse half-man,’
he points out, on the authority of Pindar, that Pelion was the
country of the Magnetes<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> and that Chiron not only dwelt in a cave
on Pelion, but is himself called a Magnete<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>. ‘It is then probable,’
he continues<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>, ‘that the Centaur myth originated in the fact that
the older race (the Pelasgians) had continued to hold out in the
mountains, ever the last refuge of the remnants of conquered races.
At first the tribes of Pelion may have been friendly to the
(Achaean) invader who was engaged in subjugating other tribes
with whom they had old feuds; and as the Norman settlers in
Ireland gave their sons to be fostered by the native Irish, so the
Achaean Peleus entrusted his son to the old Chiron. Nor must it
be forgotten that conquering races frequently regard the conquered
both with respect and aversion. They respect them for their skill
as wizards, because the older race are familiar with the spirits
of the land.... On the other hand, as the older race have been
driven into the most barren parts of the land, and are being
continually pressed still further back, and have their women
carried off, they naturally lose no opportunity of making reprisals
on their enemies, and sally forth from their homes in the mountains
or forests to plunder and in their turn to carry off women. The
conquering race consequently regard the aborigines with hatred,
and impute to them every evil quality, though when it is necessary
to employ sorcery they will always resort to one of the hated
race.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p>Then follow a series of instances from various parts of the
world which amply justify this estimate of the relations between
conquerors and conquered. But in applying the principle thus
obtained to the case of the Centaurs Prof. Ridgeway goes a little
further. ‘As it is therefore certain that aboriginal tribes who
survive in mountains and forests are considered not only possessed
of skill in magic, but as also bestial in their lusts, <i>and are even
transformed into vipers and wild beasts by the imagination of their
enemies</i>, we may reasonably infer from the Centaur myth that the
ancient Pelasgian tribes of Pelion and Ossa had been able to defy
the invaders of Thessaly, and that they had from the remotest
times possessed these mountains.</p>

<p>‘We can now explain why they are called Pheres, Centauri and
Magnetes. Scholars are agreed in holding that Pheres (<span class="greek">φῆρες</span>) is
only an Aeolic form for <span class="greek">θῆρες</span>, “wild beasts.” Such a name is not
likely to have been assumed by the tribe itself, but is rather
an opprobrious term applied to them by their enemies. Centauri
was probably the name of some particular clan of Magnetes<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>.’</p>

<p>Prof. Ridgeway then, as I understand, believes the Centauri to
have been named Pheres or ‘Beasts’ by their enemies because
they were bestial in character, and supports his view by the statement
which I have italicised. On this point I join issue.</p>

<p>First, the phrase in question is based upon one only out of the
many instances which he adduces as evidence of the relations
between invaders and aborigines&mdash;and that the most dubious, for it
depends upon a somewhat arbitrary interpretation of a passage<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> of
Procopius. ‘He wrote,’ says Prof. Ridgeway<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>, ‘in the sixth
century of Britain thus: “The people who in old time lived in
this island of Britain built a great wall, which cut off a considerable
portion of it. On either side of this wall the land, climate
and everything are different. For the district to the east of the
wall enjoys a healthy climate, changing with the seasons, being
moderately warm in summer and cool in winter. It is thickly
inhabited by people who live in the same way as other folk.”
After enumerating its natural advantages he then proceeds to say
that “On the west of the wall everything is quite the opposite; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
that, forsooth, it is impossible for a man to live there for half-an-hour.
Vipers and snakes innumerable and every kind of wild
beast share the possession of that country between them; and
what is most marvellous, the natives say that if a man crosses the
wall and enters the district beyond it, he immediately dies, being
quite unable to withstand the pestilential climate which prevails
there, and that any beasts that wander in there straightway meet
their death.”</p>

<p>‘There seems little doubt that the wall here meant is the Wall of
Hadrian, for the ancient geographers are confused about the
orientation of the island.</p>

<p>‘It is therefore probable that the vipers and wild beasts who
lived beyond the wall were nothing more than the Caledonians,
nor is it surprising to learn that a sudden death overtook either
man or beast that crossed into their territory.’</p>

<p>That a native British statement made in the sixth century to
the effect that the country beyond Hadrian’s wall was pestilential
in climate and infested with vipers, snakes, and wild beasts, should
be considered as even probable evidence that either the Romans or
the natives of Britain regarded the Caledonians as noxious animals,
is to me surprising. The question whether the Centaurs were called
Pheres because of their bestial repute among neighbouring tribes
must be decided independently of that inference and on its own
merits.</p>

<p>Secondly then, was there anything bestial in the conduct of
the Centaurs, as known to Homer, which could have won for them
the name of ‘Beasts’? All that ancient mythology tells of their
conduct may be briefly summarised; they fought with the men
and carried off the women of neighbouring tribes, and occasionally
drank wine to excess. Were the Achaeans then such ardent
abstainers that they dubbed those who indulged too freely in
intoxicants ‘Beasts’? Did the invaders of Greece and the
assailants of Troy hold fighting so reprehensible? Or was it the
Centaurs’ practice of carrying off the women of their enemies
which convicted them of ‘bestial lust’? In all ages surely
<i>humanum est errare</i>, but in that early age the practice was not
only human but manly; the enemy’s womenfolk were among the
rightful prizes of a raid. There is nothing then in mythology
to warrant the belief that the Centaurs’ moral conduct was such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
as to win for them, in that age, the opprobrious name of
‘Beasts.’</p>

<p>And here Art supports Mythology; for clearly the representation
of the Centaurs in semi-animal form cannot be dissociated
from their name of Pheres; the same idea must lie at the root of
both. If then the name Pheres was given to the Centaurs because
of their violence or lust, the animal portion of them in the representations
of early Greek Art should have been such as to express
one or both of those qualities. But what do we find? In discussing
the development of the horse-centaur in art, Miss Harrison<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
points out that though in horse-loving Athens, by the middle of
the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the equine element predominated in the
composite being, ‘in archaic representations the reverse is the case.
The Centaurs are in art what they are in reality, <i>men</i> with men’s
legs and feet, but they are shaggy mountain-men with some of the
qualities and habits of beasts; so to indicate this in a horse-loving
country they have the hind-quarters of a horse awkwardly tacked
on to their human bodies.’ Now the particular ‘qualities and
habits of beasts,’ if such there be, in the Centaurs must be their
violence and lust. Are these then adequately symbolised by ‘the
hind-quarters of a horse awkwardly tacked on to their human
bodies’? In scenes of conflict, in the archaic representations,
it is the human part of the Centaur which bears the brunt of the
fight, and the weapon used is a branch of a tree, the primitive
human weapon; the Centaur fights as a man fights. If he had
been depicted with horns or teeth or claws as his weapons of
offence, then the animal part of him would fairly symbolise his
bestial violence; but who could discover a trace of pugnacity in
his equine loins and rump, hind legs and tail? Or again if
pugnacity is not the particular quality which caused the Centaurs
to be named ‘Beasts’ and to be pourtrayed in half-animal form, is
it their lewdness which art thus endeavoured to suggest? Surely,
if the early artists had understood that the name Pheres was a
contemptuous designation of a tribe bestial in their lust, Greek
taste was not so intolerant of ithyphallic representations that they
need have had recourse to so cryptic a symbol as the hind-quarters
of a horse. But if it be supposed that, while a sense of modesty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
unknown to later generations, deterred those early artists from
a more obvious method of expressing their meaning, the idea
of the Centaurs’ lewdness was really present to their minds, then
Chiron too falls under the same condemnation and is tainted with
the same vice as the rest. ‘A black-figured vase,’ says Prof.
Ridgeway, <i>à propos</i> of the virtues, not of the vices, of this one
Centaur, ‘shows the hero (Peleus) bringing the little Achilles
to Chiron, who is depicted as a venerable old man with a white
beard and clad in a long robe from under the back of which issues
the hinder part of a diminutive pony, the equine portion being a
mere adjunct to the complete human figure<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>.’ So far then as the
animal part is concerned, the representation of Chiron in early art
differs no whit from that of other Centaurs, and the quality, which
is symbolised by the equine adjunct in these, is imputed to him
also. Yet to convict of bestial lust the virtuous Chiron, the
chosen teacher of great heroes, is intolerable. In effect, no explanation
of the name Pheres in mythology and of the biform
representation of the Centaurs in art can be really satisfactory
which does not reckon with Chiron, the most famous and ‘the
most just’ of the Centaurs, as well as with the rest of the tribe.
Some characteristic common to them all&mdash;and therefore not lust or
any other evil passion&mdash;must be the basis of any adequate interpretation
of the name ‘Beasts.’</p>

<p>If then the name Pheres cannot have been an opprobrious
term applied to the Pelasgian tribe of Centauri by the Achaean
invaders in token of their lusts or other evil qualities, can it have
been a term of respect? It may not now sound a respectful title;
but in view of that ethnological principle which Prof. Ridgeway
enunciates, namely ‘that conquering races frequently regard the
conquered both with respect and aversion,’ the enquiry is worth
pursuing. The principle itself seems to me well established; it is
only his application of it in the particular case of the Centaurs to
which I have demurred.</p>

<p>The conquering race, he shows, are apt to respect the conquered
for their skill as wizards. This certainly holds true in the
case before us. Chiron was of high repute in the arts of magic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and prophecy. It was from him that Asclepios learned ‘to be a
healer of the many-plaguing maladies of men; and thus all that
came unto him whether plagued with self-grown sores or with
limbs wounded by the lustrous bronze or stone far-hurled, or
marred by summer heat or winter cold&mdash;these he delivered,
loosing each from his several infirmity, some with emollient spells
and some by kindly potions, or else he hung their limbs with
charms, or by surgery he raised them up to health<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>.’ And it was
Chiron too to whom Apollo himself resorted for counsel, and from
whom he learned the blissful destiny of the maiden Cyrene<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. Nor
was Chiron the only exponent of such arts among the Centaurs;
for Hesiod names also Asbolos as a diviner.</p>

<p>If then the tribe of Centaurs enjoyed a reputation for sorcery,
could this have won for them the name of ‘Beasts’? Can it have
been that, in the exercise of their magic powers, they were believed
able to transform themselves into beasts?</p>

<p>Within the limits of Greek folk-lore we have already once
encountered such a belief, namely in the case of the ‘Striges,’ old
witches capable of turning themselves into birds of prey; and
in the folk-lore of the world at large the idea is extremely
frequent. There is no need to encumber this chapter with a mass
of recorded instances; the verdict of the first authority on the
subject is sufficient. According to Tylor<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>, the belief ‘that certain
men, by natural gift or magic art, can turn for a time into ravening
wild beasts’ is ‘a widespread belief, extending through savage,
barbaric, classic, oriental, and mediaeval life, and surviving to this
day in European superstition.’ ‘The origin of this idea,’ he says,
‘is by no means sufficiently explained,’ but he notes that ‘it really
occurs that, in various forms of mental disease, patients prowl
shyly, long to bite and destroy mankind, and even fancy themselves
transformed into wild beasts.’ Whether such cases of
insanity are the cause or the effect of the belief, he does not
determine; but he adds, what is most important to the present
issue, that ‘professional sorcerers have taken up the idea, as they
do any morbid delusion, and pretend to turn themselves and
others into beasts by magic art’; and, later on<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>, citing by way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
of illustration a passage of the <i>Eclogues</i><a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>, in which Vergil ‘tells of
Moeris as turning into a wolf by the use of poisonous herbs, as
calling up souls from the tombs, and as bewitching away crops,’
he points out that in the popular opinion of Vergil’s age ‘the arts
of the werewolf, the necromancer or “medium,” and the witch,
were different branches of one craft.’</p>

<p>If then the Centaurs were a tribe of reputed sorcerers and
also obtained the secondary name of ‘Beasts,’ the analogy of worldwide
superstitions suggests that the link between these two facts
is to be found in their magical power of assuming the shape of
beasts.</p>

<p>What particular beast-shape the Centaurs most often affected
need not much concern us. The analogy, on which my interpretation
of the name Pheres rests, makes certainly for some shape
more terrifying than that of a horse; and the word <span class="greek">φῆρες</span> itself
also denotes wild and savage beasts rather than domestic animals.
But the horse-centaur, though it monopolised art, was not the
only form of centaur known, nor, if we may judge from modern
descriptions of the Callicantzari, had it so firm a hold on the
popular imagination as some other types. Possibly its very existence
is due only to the aesthetic taste of a horse-loving people.
Pindar certainly knew of one Centaurus earlier in date and far
more monstrous than the horse-centaurs which artists chose to
depict, and provided a genealogy accordingly. Moreover in the
passage of Hesiod which I have quoted above and which, by its
agreement with the <i>Iliad</i> as to the human character of the
Centaurs, is proved to embody an early tradition, there is at least
a suggestion of a more savage form assumed by the Centaurs.
Several of their names in that passage<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> seem to indicate various
qualities and habits which they possessed. One is called Petraeos,
because the Centaurs lived in rocky caves or because they hurled
rocks at their foes; another is Oureios, because they were a
mountain-tribe; then there are the two sons of Peukeus, so named
because the Centaurs’ weapons were pine-branches. And why is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
another named Arctos? Is it not because the Centaurs assumed
by sorcery the form of bears? There is some probability then
that the equine type of Centaur, the conventional Centaur of
Greek Art, was a comparatively late development, and that the
remote age which gave to the Centaurs the name of Pheres
believed rather that that tribe of sorcerers were wont to transform
themselves into the more monstrous and terrible shapes of bears
and other wild beasts.</p>

<p>But if the particular animal which Greek artists selected as a
component part of their Centaurs is thus of minor importance, the
fact that their Centaurs were always composite in conception,
always compounded of the human and the animal, is highly
significant. In discussing the various types of Callicantzari in
various parts of Greece, we found that, where there exists a belief
in their power of metamorphosis, they are stated to appear in
single and complete shapes, while, where the belief in their transformation
is unknown, they are represented in composite shapes;
and having previously concluded that the belief in their metamorphosis
was a genuine and original factor in the superstition, we
were led to formulate the principle, that a being of some single,
normal, and known shape who has originally been believed capable
of transforming himself into one or more other single, normal,
and known shapes, comes to be represented, when the belief in his
power of transformation dies out, as a being of composite, abnormal,
and fantastic shape, combining incongruous features of the several
single, normal, and known shapes. Now the horse-centaur of Greek
Art is a being of composite, abnormal, and fantastic shape, combining
incongruous features of man and animal. If then the
principle based on facts of modern Greek folk-lore may be applied
to the facts of ancient Greek folk-lore, the horse-centaur of Greek
Art replaced a completely human Centaur capable of transforming
himself into completely animal form.</p>

<p>Moreover I am inclined to think that such a development was
likely to occur in the representations of art even more readily than
in verbal descriptions. For even if the artist belonged to an age
which had not yet forgotten that the Centaurs were human beings
capable of turning themselves by sorcery into beasts, how was
he to distinguish the Centaur in his picture either from an
ordinary man, if the Centaur were in his ordinary human shape, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
from a real animal, if the Centaur were in his assumed shape?
He might of course have drawn an ordinary man and have
inscribed the legend, ‘This is a Centaur capable of assuming other
forms’; or he might have drawn an ordinary animal with the
explanatory note, ‘This is not really an animal but a Centaur
in disguise.’ But if such expedients did not satisfy his artistic
instincts, what was he to do? Surely his only course was to
depict the Centaur in his normal human shape, and by some
animal adjunct to indicate his powers of transformation. And
that is what he did; for in the earliest art the fore part of the
Centaur is a complete human figure, and the hind part is a somewhat
disconnected equine appendage<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is this artistic convention without parallel in ancient
Greece. At Phigalea there was once, we are told, an ancient
statue of Demeter represented as a woman with the head and
mane of a horse; and the explanation of this equine adjunct
was that she had once assumed the form of a mare<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>. In other
words, the power of transformation was indicated in art by a
composite form.</p>

<p>Hence indeed it is not unlikely that the very method which
early artists adopted of indicating the Centaurs’ power to assume
various single forms, being misunderstood by later generations
among whom the Centaurs’ human origin and faculty of magical
transformation were no longer predominant traditions, contributed
not a little to the conception of Centaurs in an invariable composite
form; and that later art, by blending the two incongruous
elements into a more harmonious but less significant whole, confirmed
men in that misunderstanding, until the old traditions
became a piece of rare and local lore.</p>

<p>Thus on three separate grounds&mdash;the analogy of world-wide
superstition which attributes to sorcerers the power of assuming
bestial form; the tendency detected in modern Greek folk-lore to
replace beings of single shape, but capable of transforming themselves
into other single shapes, by creatures of composite shape;
and the contrast between the horse-centaurs of archaic art and
those of the Parthenon&mdash;we are led to the same conclusion, namely
that the Centaurs were a tribe of reputed sorcerers whose most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
striking manifestation of power, in the eyes of their Achaean
neighbours, was to turn themselves into wild beasts. The name
Pheres was then in truth a title of respect, a title in no way
derogatory to the virtuous Chiron, who, if he exercised his
magical powers chiefly in mercy and healing, shared doubtless
with the other Centaurs the miraculous faculty of metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Our first conclusion then concerning the Callicantzari, namely
that they were originally men capable of turning into beasts, was
no less correct than the second conclusion which showed them as
the modern representatives of Dionysus’ attendant Satyrs and
Sileni. Where the beliefs in their human origin and in their
power of metamorphosis still prevail, Greek tradition has preserved
not only the name but the essential character of the ancient
Centaurs.</p>

<p>Does it seem hardly credible that popular tradition should still
faithfully record a superstition which dates from before Homer
and yet is practically ignored by Greek literature? Still if the
fidelity of the common-folk’s memory is guaranteed in many details
by its agreement with that which literature does record, it would
be folly to disregard it where literature is silent or prefers another
of the still prevalent traditions. Let us take only Apollodorus’
account<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> of the fight of Heracles with the Centaurs and mark the
several points in which it confirms the present beliefs about the
Callicantzari. The old home, he says, of the Centaurs before they
came to Malea was Pelion; Pelion is now the place where above
all others stories of the Callicantzari are rife; and in the neighbouring
island of Sciathos it is believed<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> that they come at
Christmas not from the lower world, but from the mainland, the
old country of the Magnetes; even local associations then seem
to have survived, just as in the modern stories about Demeter
from Eleusis and from Phigaleia. Heracles was entertained in
the cave of the Centaur Pholos; the Callicantzari likewise live in
caves during their sojourn on earth, and their hospitality, though
never sought, has been endured. The Centaur Pholos ate raw
meat, though he provided his guest with cooked meat; the
Callicantzari also regale themselves on uncooked food<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>, toads and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
snakes for the most part, but in one Messenian story also raw
dogs’-flesh<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>. Heracles broached a cask of wine, and Pholos’ brother
Centaurs smelt it and swarmed to the cave on mischief bent; the
Callicantzari have the same love of wine and the same malevolence.
The first of the Centaurs to enter the cave were put to
flight by Heracles with fire-brands, and his ordinary weapon, the
bow, was not used by him save to complete the rout; fire-brands
are the right weapons with which to scare away the Callicantzari.
Surely, when such correspondences as these attest the integrity of
popular tradition for some two thousand years, there is nothing
incredible in the supposition that there had been equal integrity
in popular (as opposed to artistic and literary) traditions for
another thousand years or more before that.</p>

<p>Thus then it appears that in some districts of modern Greece,
in which there prevail the beliefs that the Callicantzari are, in
their normal form, human and that they are capable of transforming
themselves into beasts, popular tradition dates from the age
in which the Achaean invaders credited the Pelasgian tribe of
Centauri with magical powers and in token of one special manifestation
thereof surnamed them Pheres.</p>

<p>In other districts, where the Callicantzari are represented as
demoniacal and not human and as monsters of mixed rather than
of variable shape, the popular memory goes back to a period somewhat
less remote, that period in which a new conception, encouraged
perhaps unwittingly by archaic art, became predominant in classical
art and literature, with the further result, we must suppose, that
in the minds of some of the common-folk too monsters of composite
shape took the place of the old human wonder-working Centaurs.</p>

<p>And yet again in other districts, where the Christmas mummers
in the guise of Callicantzari are the modern representatives of
those worshippers of Dionysus who dressed themselves in the
guise of Satyrs or Sileni, the traditions which survive are mainly
those of a post-classical age in which the half-human half-animal
comrades of Dionysus lost their distinctive names and were enrolled
in the Centaurs’ ranks.</p>

<p>Finally in the few districts where language at least testifies
that werewolves have also been numbered among the Callicantzari,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
popular belief, though preserving much that is ancient, may have
been modified by a superstition, or rather by an actual form of
insanity, which was particularly prevalent in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Such have been in different districts and periods the various
developments of a superstition which originated in the reputation
for sorcery enjoyed by a Pelasgian tribe inhabiting Mount Pelion
in a prehistoric age; and the complexity of modern traditions
concerning the Callicantzari is due to the fact that they do not all
date from one epoch but comprise the whole history of the Centaurs.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 14. <span class="smcap">Genii.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The tale of deities is now almost told. There remain only a
few miscellaneous beings, identical or, at the least, comparable
with the creations of ancient superstition, who may be classed
together under the name of <span class="greek">στοιχει̯ά</span><a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> (anciently <span class="greek">στοιχεῖα</span>) or, to
adopt the exact Latin equivalent, <i>genii</i>.</p>

<p>The Greek word, which in classical times served as a fair
equivalent for any sense of our word ‘elements,’ became from
Plato’s time onward a technical term in physics for those first
beginnings of the material world which Empedocles had previously
called <span class="greek">ῥιζώματα</span> and other philosophers <span class="greek">ἀρχαί</span>. The
physical elements however were commonly supposed to be haunted
each by its own peculiar spirit, and hence among the later
Platonists the term <span class="greek">στοιχεῖα</span> became a technicality of demonology
rather than of natural science<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>. Every component part of the
visible universe was credited with an invisible <i>genius</i>, a spirit
whose being was in some way bound up with the existence of its
abode; and the term <span class="greek">στοιχεῖον</span> was transferred from the material
to the spiritual.</p>

<p>But though the Platonists invented and introduced this new
sense of the word, its widespread acceptance was probably not
their work, but a curious accident resulting from misinterpretation
of early Christian writings. In St Paul’s Epistles<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> there occurs
several times a phrase, <span class="greek">τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου</span>, ‘worldly principles,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
which was apparently a little too cultured for many of those who
heard or read it. It conveyed to their minds probably no more
than ‘being enslaved to weak and beggarly elements<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>’ conveys to
the British peasant of to-day. What more natural then than that
the commentator should accept the word in the sense given to it by
the Platonists, and that the common-folk who heard his exposition
should readily identify the <span class="greek">στοιχεῖα</span> whom they were bidden no
longer to serve with the lesser deities and local <i>genii</i> to whose
service they had long been bound&mdash;to whose service moreover in
spite of the supposed injunction they have always continued
faithful? The Church, they would have felt, acknowledged the
existence of these beings; ecclesiastical authority endorsed ancestral
tradition; and since such beings existed, it were folly to
ignore them; nay, since the Church declared that they were
powers of evil, it was but prudent to propitiate them, to appease
their malevolence. Thus <span class="greek">στοιχεῖα</span> came to be reckoned by every
right-minded peasant among his regular demoniacal <i>entourage</i>.
And so they remain&mdash;some of them hostile to man, some benevolent,
but all alike wild, uncontrollable spirits&mdash;so that St Paul’s
phrase <span class="greek">στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου</span> even appears in one folk-song metaphorically
as a description of wild and wilful young men<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the very origin of the term rendered it comprehensive
in meaning. Even the greater deities of ancient Greece
were, in a sense, local&mdash;the occupants of prescribed domains;
Poseidon might logically be called the <i>genius</i> of the sea, Demeter
of the corn-land; while lesser deities were always associated with
particular spots and often unknown elsewhere. But mediaeval
usage of the word <span class="greek">στοιχεῖον</span> and of its derivatives tended to widen
the meaning of the word yet more. A verb <span class="greek">στοιχειοῦν</span><a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> was
formed which properly meant to settle a <i>genius</i> in a particular
place&mdash;either a beneficent <i>genius</i> to act as tutelary deity, or
an evil <i>genius</i> whose range of activity would thus be circumscribed
within known and narrower limits; but it was used
also in a larger sense to denote the exercise of any magical
powers. A corresponding adjective <span class="greek">στοιχειωματικός</span><a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> was applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to anyone who had dealings with genii or familiar spirits,
and more vaguely to wizards in general. Thus the famous
magician Apollonius of Tyana is described as a ‘Pythagorean
philosopher with power over <i>genii</i>’ (<span class="greek">φιλόσοφος Πυθαγόρειος
στοιχειωματικός</span>)<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>; and two out of his many miracles may be
taken as typical of his exercise of the power. Once, it is recorded,
he was summoned to Byzantium by the inhabitants and there ‘he
charmed (<span class="greek">ἐστοιχείωσεν</span>) snakes and scorpions not to strike,
mosquitoes totally to disappear, horses to be quiet and not to be
vicious either towards each other or towards man; the river Lycus
also he charmed (<span class="greek">ἐστοιχείωσεν</span>) not to flood and do damage to
Byzantium<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>.’ In the first part of this passage the verb is undoubtedly
used in a very lax sense, for snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes,
and horses can hardly have been conceived to have their own
several <i>genii</i> or guardian-spirits upon whom magic could be
exercised; but the charming of the river Lycus certainly suggests
the restraining of the <span class="greek">στοιχεῖον</span> or <i>genius</i> of the river within
settled bounds. This stricter sense of the word however comes
out more clearly in relation to good <i>genii</i> who were settled by
magical charms in any given object or place. Hence even the
word <span class="greek">στοιχεῖον</span> reverted to a material sense, and was sometimes
employed to mean a ‘talisman<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>’&mdash;an object, that is, in which resided
a <i>genius</i> capable of averting wars, pestilences, and suchlike. <i>Genii</i>
of this kind, we are told, were settled by the same Apollonius in
the statues throughout Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>, where the belief in their
efficacy seems to have been generally accepted; for there was to
be seen there a cross in the middle of which was ‘the fortune of
the city, namely a small chain having its ends locked together
and possessed of power to keep the city abounding in all manner
of goods and to give her victory ever over the nations (or heathen),
that they should have strength no more to approach and draw
nigh thereto, but should hold further aloof from her and retreat
as though they had been vanquished. And the key of the chain
was buried in the foundations of the pillars<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>’ on which the cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
rested. The locked chain was probably the magical means by
which the tutelary <i>genius</i> of the city was kept at his post.</p>

<p>But these wide and vague usages of the word and its derivatives
have now for the most part disappeared. Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> still
used <span class="greek">στοιχειωματικός</span> in the sense of ‘magician,’ but I have not
found it in modern Greek. A remnant of the verb <span class="greek">στοιχειοῦν</span><a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> is
seen in the past participle <span class="greek">στοιχειωμένος</span>, which at the present day
is applied in its true sense to objects ‘haunted by <i>genii</i>.’ And the
word <span class="greek">στοιχειά</span>, though locally extended in scope so as to become
in effect synonymous with <span class="greek">δαιμόνια</span> or <span class="greek">ἐξωτικά</span><a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>, comprising all
non-Christian deities irrespectively of their close connexion with
particular natural phenomena, still maintains in its more strict,
and I think more frequent, usage the meaning of <i>genii</i>.</p>

<p>The term thus provided by the Platonists and popularised
accidentally by the Church is a convenience in the classification
of demons; for the ancient Greeks had no popular word which was
exactly equivalent; they had to choose between the vague term
<span class="greek">δαιμόνιον</span> which implied nothing of attachment to any place or
object, and the special designation of the particular kind of <i>genius</i>.
The Latin tongue was in this respect better supplied. It must
not however be inferred that the introduction of the useful
term <span class="greek">στοιχεῖα</span> into the demonological nomenclature of Greece
marked any innovation in popular superstition. The Greeks no
less than the Romans had from time immemorial believed in
<i>genii</i>. That scene of the <i>Aeneid</i><a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>, in which, while Aeneas is
holding a memorial feast in honour of his father, a snake appears
and tastes of the offerings and itself in turn is honoured with
fresh sacrifice as being either the genius of the place or an
attendant of the hero Anchises, is throughout Greek in tone; and
the comment of Servius thereupon, ‘There is no place without a
<i>genius</i>, which usually manifests itself in the form of a snake,’
revives a hundred memories of sacred snakes tended in the
temples or depicted on the tombs of ancient Greece. Moreover
several of the supernatural beings whom I have already described,
and whose identity with the creatures of ancient superstition is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
established, are essentially <i>genii</i>. The Lamia is the <i>genius</i> of the
darksome cave where she makes her lair; the Gorgon, of the
straits where she waylays her prey; and, most clearly of all, the
Dryads are the <i>genii</i> of the trees which they inhabit. For the
life of each one of them is bound up with the life of the tree in
which she dwells; and still as in old time, so surely as the tree
decays away with age, her life too is done and ‘her soul leaves
therewith the light of the sun<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>.’ The woodman of to-day therefore
speaks with the utmost fidelity to ancient tradition when he calls
the trees where his Nereids dwell <span class="greek">στοιχειωμένα δέντρα</span>, ‘trees
haunted by <i>genii</i>’; such innovation as there has been is in terminology
only.</p>

<p>One word of caution only is required before we proceed to the
consideration of various species of <i>genii</i> not yet described. It must
not be assumed that all <i>genii</i>, on the analogy of the tree-nymphs,
die along with the dissolution of their dwelling-places; the existence
of the <i>genius</i> and that of the haunted object are indeed always
closely and intimately united, but not necessarily in such a manner
as to preclude the migration of the <i>genius</i> on the dissolution of
its first abode into a second. The converse proposition however,
that any object could enjoy prolonged existence after the departure
from it of the indwelling power, may be considered improbable.</p>

<p>The <i>genii</i> with whom I now propose to deal fall into five
main divisions according to their habitations. These are first
buildings, secondly water, thirdly mountains, caves, and desert
places, fourthly the air, fifthly human beings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>genii</i> of buildings are universally acknowledged in Greece.
The forms in which they appear are various; this may partly
be explained by the belief that they possess the power of assuming
different shapes at will; but it is certain also that their
normal shape is in some measure determined by the nature of
the building&mdash;house, church, or bridge&mdash;of which each is the
guardian.</p>

<p>The <i>genius</i> of a house appears almost always in the guise of a
snake, or, according to Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>, of a lizard or other reptile. It
is believed to have its permanent dwelling in the foundations, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
not infrequently some hole or crevice in a rough cottage-floor is
regarded as the entrance to its home. About such holes peasants
have been known to sprinkle bread-crumbs<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>; and I have been
informed, though I cannot vouch as an eye-witness for the statement,
that on the festival of that saint whose name the master of
a house bears, he will sometimes combine services to both his
Christian and his pagan tutelary deities, substituting wine for the
water on which the oil of the sacred lamp before the saint’s icon
usually floats, and pouring a libation of milk&mdash;for the older deities
disapprove of intoxicants&mdash;about the aperture which leads down
to the subterranean home of the <i>genius</i>. If it so happen that
there is a snake in the hole and the milky deluge compels it
speedily to issue from its hiding-place, its appearance in the house
is greeted with a silent delight or with a few words of welcome
quietly spoken. For on no account must the ‘guardian of the
house,’ <span class="greek">νοικοκύρης</span><a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> or <span class="greek">τόπακας</span><a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>, as it is sometimes called, be
frightened by any sound or sudden movement. Much less of
course must any physical hurt or violence be done to it; the consequences
of such action, even though it be due merely to inadvertence,
are swift and terrible; the house itself falls, or the
member of the family who was guilty of the outrage dies in the
self-same way in which he slew the snake<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>.</p>

<p>These beliefs and customs are probably all of ancient date.
Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> notes how the superstitious man, if he sees a snake
in the house, sets up a shrine for it on the spot. The observation
also of such snakes was a recognised department of ‘domestic
divination’ (<span class="greek">οἰκοσκοπική</span>) on which one Xenocrates&mdash;not the
disciple of Plato&mdash;wrote a treatise<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>. They were probably known
as <span class="greek">οἰκουροί</span>, ‘guardians of the house’ (a name which is identical in
meaning with the modern <span class="greek">νοικοκύρης</span>), for it is thus at any rate
that Hesychius<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> designates the great snake which Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> tells
us was ‘guardian (<span class="greek">φύλακα</span>) of the acropolis’ at Athens, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
which, by leaving untouched the honey-cake with which it was
fed every month, proved to the Athenians, when the second
Persian invasion was threatening them, that their tutelary deity
had departed from the acropolis, and decided them likewise to
evacuate the city. Thus the few facts that are recorded about
this belief in antiquity accord so exactly with modern observations,
that from the minuter detail of the latter the outlines of the
former may safely be filled in.</p>

<p>The <i>genii</i> of churches most commonly are seen or heard in
the form of oxen&mdash;bulls for the most part<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>, but also steers and
heifers<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>. They appear, like all <i>genii</i>, most frequently at night,
and, according to one authority, ‘are adorned with various precious
stones which diffuse a brightness such as to light the whole
church.’ ‘They are seldom harmful,’ continues the same writer<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>;
‘the few that are so&mdash;called simply <span class="greek">κακά</span>&mdash;do not dare to make their
abode within the churches, but have their lairs close to them in
order to do hurt to church-goers.... Near Calamáta, on a mountain-side,
there is a chapel of ease dedicated to St George. The
peasants narrate that at each annual festival held there on
April 23rd a <i>genius</i> used to issue forth from a hole close by and
to devour one of the festal gathering. After some years the good
people, seeing that there was no remedy for this annual catastrophe,
decided to give up the festival. But a week before the feast
St George appeared to them all simultaneously in a dream, and
assured them that they should suffer no hurt at the festival,
because he had sealed up the monster. And in fact they went
there and found the hole closed by a massive stone, on which
was imprinted the mark of a horse’s hoof; for St George,
willing that the hole should remain always closed, had made
his horse strike the stone with his hoof. Thenceforth the saint
has borne the surname <span class="greek">Πεταλώτης</span> (from <span class="greek">πέταλον</span> the ‘shoe’ or
‘hoof’ of a horse) and up to this day is shewn the hoof-mark
upon a stone.’</p>

<p>Harmless <i>genii</i> however are more frequently assigned to
churches, exercising a kind of wardenship over them and taking
an interest in the parishioners. At Marousi, a village near
Athens, there is a church which is still believed to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
<i>genius</i>, in the form of a bull, lurking in its foundations; and when
any parishioner is about to die, the bull is heard to bellow three
times at midnight. A church in Athens used to claim the same
distinction, and the bellowing of the bull there is said to have
been heard within living memory at the death of an old man
named Lioules<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>. Other churches also in Athens, not to be outdone,
pretended to the possession of <i>genii</i> in the shapes of a
snake, a black cock, and a woman, who all followed the bull’s
example and emitted their appropriate cries thrice at midnight
as a presage of similar events<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>.</p>

<p>Why the <i>genii</i> of churches in particular appear mostly as bulls,
I cannot determine. When the <i>genius</i> of a river manifests itself
in that form, the connexion with antiquity is obvious; for river-gods,
who <i>ex vi termini</i> are the <i>genii</i> of the rivers whose name
they share, were constantly pourtrayed of old in the form of
bulls. All that can be said is that the type of <i>genius</i> is old,
though its localisation is new and difficult to explain.</p>

<p>The <i>genii</i> of bridges cannot properly, I suppose, be distinguished
from the <i>genii</i> of those rivers or ravines which the bridges
span. They are usually depicted as dragons or other formidable
monsters, and they are best known for the cruel toll which they
exact when the bridge is a-building. The original conception
is doubtless that of the river-god demanding a sacrifice, even of
human life, in compensation for men’s encroachment upon his
domain. The most famous of the folk-songs which celebrate
such a theme is associated with ‘the Bridge of Arta,’ but many
versions<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> of it have been published from different districts, and
in some the names of other bridges are substituted; in Crete the
story is attached to the ‘shaking bridge’ over a mountain torrent
near Canea<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>; in the Peloponnese to ‘the Lady’s bridge’ over the
river Ladon<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>; in the neighbourhood of Thermopylae to a bridge
over the river Helláda<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>; in the island of Cos to the old bridge of
Antimachia<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>. The song, in the version<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> which I select, runs thus:</p>

<p>But while the most famous examples of sacrifice to <i>genii</i> are
connected with bridges, the custom in a less criminal form than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
that which the folk-songs celebrate is common throughout Greece
to-day. In building a house or any other edifice, the question
of propitiating the <i>genius</i> already in possession of the site and
of inducing it to become the guardian of the building is duly
considered. Sacrifice is done. The peace-offering, according to
the importance of the building and the means of the future
owner, may consist of an ox, a ram, a he-goat, or a cock (or,
less commonly, of a hen with her brood<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>), preferably of black
colour, as were in old time victims designed for gods beneath
the earth. The selected animal is in Acarnania and Aetolia<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
taken to the site, and there its throat is cut so that the blood
may fall on the foundation-stone, beneath which the body is
then interred. In some other places<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> it suffices to mark a cross
upon the stone with the victim’s blood. In the same district the
practice of taking auspices from the victim&mdash;from the shoulder-blade
in the case of a ram and from the breast-bone in the case
of a cock&mdash;is occasionally combined with the sacrifice, but is not
essential to the ceremony.</p>

<p>But animals, though they are the only victims actually
slaughtered upon the spot, are not the only form of peace-offering.
Even at the present day when, added to the power
of the law, a sense of humanity, or a fear of being pronounced
‘uncivilised,’ tends to deter the peasantry even of the most
outlying districts from actually satisfying the more savage
instincts of hereditary superstition, there still exists a strong
feeling that a human victim is preferable to an animal for
ensuring the stability of a building. Fortunately therefore
for the builder’s peace of mind, the principles of sympathetic
magic offer a compromise between actual murder and total
disregard of the traditional rite. It suffices to obtain from a
man or woman&mdash;an enemy for choice but, failing that, ‘out of
philanthropy’ as a Greek authority puts it, any aged person
whose term of life is well-nigh done&mdash;some such object as a
hair or the paring of a nail, or again a shred of his clothing or
a cast-off shoe, or it may be a thread or stick<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> marked with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
measure either of the footprint or of the full stature of the person,
and to bury it beneath the foundation-stone of the new edifice.
By this proceeding a human victim is devoted to the <i>genius</i> of
the site, and will die within the year as surely as if an image
of him were moulded in wax and a needle run through its heart.
Another variation of the same rite consists in enticing some
passer-by to the spot and laying the foundation-stone upon his
shadow. In Santorini I myself was once saved from such a fate
by the rough benevolence of a stranger who dragged me back
from the place where I was standing and adjured me to watch
the proceedings from the other side of the trench where my shadow
could not fall across the foundations. Nor are the invited guests
immune; unenviable therefore is the position of those persons
who are officially required to assist at the laying of the foundation-stones
of churches and other public buildings. The demarch
(or mayor) of Agrinion informed me that, according to the belief
of the common-folk in the neighbourhood, his four immediate
predecessors in office had all fallen victims to this their public
duty; and he described to me the concern and consternation of
his own women-folk when he himself had recently braved the
ordeal. He honestly allowed too that he had kept his shadow
clear of the dangerous spot.</p>

<p>So much importance is attached to these foundation-ceremonies
that the Church has provided a special office to be read alike for
cathedral or for cottage; and the priest who attends for this
purpose is sometimes induced to pronounce a blessing on the
animal that is to be sacrificed. This however is the more expensive
rite; the victim has to be bought, and the priest expects
a fee for blessing it; whereas the immolation of a shadow-victim
costs nothing, is more efficacious as being equivalent to a human
sacrifice, and provides an excellent means for removing an enemy
with impunity.</p>

<p>The sacrificial ceremony is also sometimes performed on other
occasions than those of the laying of foundation-stones. In Athens
a precept of popular wisdom enjoins the slaughtering of a black
cock when a new quarry is opened<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>; and an interesting account
is given by Bent<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> of a similar scene at the launching of a ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
in Santorini. ‘When they have built a new vessel, they have
a grand ceremony at the launching, or benediction, as they call
it here, at which the priest officiates; and the crowd eagerly
watch, as she glides into the water, the position she takes, for
an omen is attached to this. It is customary to slaughter an
ox, a lamb or a dove on these occasions, according to the wealth
of the proprietor and the size of the ship, and with the blood to
make a cross on the deck. After this the captain jumps off the
bows into the sea with all his clothes on, and the ceremony is
followed by a banquet and much rejoicing.’ Here it is reasonable
to suppose that the captain by jumping into the sea goes through
the form of offering himself as a sacrifice to the <i>genius</i> of the sea,
and that the animal actually slaughtered is a surrogate victim
in his stead.</p>

<p>The strength of these superstitions to-day, as gauged by the
shifts and compromises to which the peasants resort in order to
satisfy their scruples, goes far to guarantee the historical accuracy
of such ballads as ‘the Bridge of Arta.’ Not of course that each
of the numerous versions with all its local colouring is to be taken
as evidence of human sacrifice in each place named; exactitude
of detail cannot be claimed for them. But as a faithful picture
of the beliefs and customs prevalent not more perhaps than
two or three centuries ago they deserve full credence. Both
the wide dispersion of the several versions, and also the skill
with which in each of them the action of the master-builder
evokes feelings not of aversion but rather of pity for a man of
whom religious duty demanded the sacrifice of his own wife,
furnish plain proof of the domination which the superstition
in its most gruesome form once exercised; and the intentions
of the modern peasants, if not their acts, testify to the same
overwhelming dread of <i>genii</i>.</p>

<p>That the ceremonies which I have described are in general
of the nature of sacrifices to <i>genii</i> is beyond question. In the
version of ‘the Bridge of Arta’ which I have translated, both
the <i>genius</i> and the victim whom he demands appear as <i>dramatis
personae</i>. Again, in some districts the word ‘sacrifice’ (<span class="greek">θυσιό</span><a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
or <span class="greek">θυσία</span><a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>) is actually still applied to the rite. Finally, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the victims are of various kinds and the forms in which a genius
may appear equally various, the distinction between the two is
as a rule kept clear; cases of a single species of animal serving
for both <i>genius</i> and victim&mdash;of the <i>genius</i> for example appearing
as a cock or of the chosen victim being a snake&mdash;are extremely
rare.</p>

<p>Confusion of the two nevertheless does occur; the original
<i>genius</i> of the site is sometimes forgotten, and the victim is conceived
to be slain and buried in order that from the under-world
it may exercise a guardianship over the building which is its
tomb. Thus in one version of ‘the Bridge of Arta,’ inferior in
many respects to that which I have translated, the complaint of
the master-craftsman’s wife contains the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="greek">τρεῖς ἀδερφούλαις εἴμασταν, ταὶς τρεῖς στοιχειὰ μᾶς βάλαν</span><a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Three sisters we, and all the three they took for guardian-demons.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Probably the same confusion of thought was responsible for the
representation of the <i>genius</i> of a church in Athens in the shape
of a cock, which is the commonest kind of victim; and possibly
too the bulls which are so frequently the guardians of churches
were originally the victims considered most suitable for the
foundation of such important edifices. This error of belief has
undoubtedly been facilitated by the use of a word which in its
mediaeval meanings has already been discussed&mdash;the verb <span class="greek">στοιχειόνω</span>.
This, as I have pointed out, meant strictly ‘to provide
(a place or object) with a <i>genius</i>.’ But in modern usage it can
take an accusative of the victim devoted to a <i>genius</i> no less than
of the place provided with a <i>genius</i>. In Zacynthos and Cephalonia,
says Bernhard Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>, the phrase <span class="greek">στοιχειόνω ἀρνί</span>, for example,
meaning ‘I devote a lamb’ to the <i>genius</i>, is in regular use; and
so too in the above rendering of ‘the Bridge of Arta,’ the phrase
which I have translated ‘an ye devote not human life’ is in
the Greek <span class="greek">ἂν δὲ στοιχειώσετ’ ἄνθρωπο</span>. Now verbs of this form
are in both ancient and modern Greek usually causative. The
ancient <span class="greek">δηλόω</span> and modern <span class="greek">δηλόνω</span> mean ‘I make (an object)
clear’ (<span class="greek">δῆλος</span>): the ancient <span class="greek">χρυσόω</span> and modern <span class="greek">χρυσόνω</span> mean
‘I make (an object) gold’ (<span class="greek">χρυσός</span>). Similarly <span class="greek">στοιχειόνω</span> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
readily taken to mean ‘I make (an animal or person) the <i>genius</i>’
(<span class="greek">στοιχεῖον</span>) of a place. If therefore this word continued to be
applied to the rite of slaughtering an animal at foundation-ceremonies
in any place where the true purport of the custom,
as often happens, had been forgotten, language itself would at
once suggest that erroneous interpretation of the custom of which
we have seen examples; the victim would be raised to the rank
of <i>genius</i>.</p>

<p>This development of modern superstition supplies a clue for
tracing the evolution of ancient Greek religion, which has hitherto
been missed by those who have dealt with the subject<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. They have
generally compared with the modern Greek superstition similar
beliefs and customs prevalent throughout the Balkans and even
beyond them, and have thence inferred that the practice of
sacrificing to the <i>genii</i> of sites selected for building was of
Slavonic importation. The wide distribution of the superstition
in the Balkans, especially among the Slavonic peoples, is a fact;
but the inference goes too far. To Slavonic influence I impute
the recrudescence of the superstition in its most barbarous form,
involving human sacrifice, during the Middle Ages. Ancient
history, even ancient mythology, contains no story so suggestive
of barbarity as one brief statement made by Suidas:
‘At St Mamas there was a large bridge consisting of twelve
arches (for there was much water coming down), and there a
brazen dragon was set up, because it was thought that a dragon
inhabited the place; and there many maidens were sacrificed<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.’
The date of the events to which the passage refers cannot be
ascertained; but I certainly suspect it to be subsequent to the
Slavonic invasion of Greece. Yet even so the Slavs did not
initiate a new custom but merely stimulated the native belief
that <i>genii</i> required sacrifice in compensation for the building of
any edifice on their domains. This belief dated from the Homeric
age&mdash;nay, was already old when the Achaeans built their great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
wall with lofty towers, a bulwark for them and their ships against
the men of Ilium.</p>

<p>‘Thus,’ we read, ‘did they labour, even the long-haired
Achaeans; but the gods sitting beside Zeus that wieldeth the
lightning gazed in wonder on the mighty work of the bronze-clad
Achaeans. And to them did Poseidon the earth-shaker open
speech: “Father Zeus, is there now one mortal on the boundless
earth, that will henceforth declare unto immortals his mind and
purpose? Seest thou not that contrariwise the long-haired
Achaeans have built a wall to guard their ships and driven a
trench about it, and have not offered unto the gods fair sacrifice?
Verily their wall shall be famed far as Dawn spreads her light;
and that which I with Phoebus Apollo toiled to build for the hero
Laomedon will men forget.” And unto him spake Zeus that
gathereth the clouds, sore-vexed: “Fie on thee, thou earth-shaker
whose sway is wide, for this thy word. Well might this device of
men dismay some other god lesser than thou by far in work and
will; but thou verily shalt be famed far as Dawn spreads her
light. Go to; when the long-haired Achaeans be gone again with
their ships unto their own native land, break thou down their
wall and cast it all into the sea and cover again the vast shore
with sand, that so the Achaeans’ great wall may be wiped out
from thy sight<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>.”’ And later in the <i>Iliad</i> we read of the fulfilment;
how that the rivers of the Trojan land were marshalled
and led by Poseidon, his trident in his hands, to the assault of the
wall that ‘had been fashioned without the will of the gods and
could no long time endure<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>.’</p>

<p>The whole passage finds its best commentary in modern
superstition. Poseidon, though a great god, is the local <i>genius</i>;
to him belongs the shore where the Greek ships are assembled,
to him too the land where he had built the town of Ilium; to
him therefore were due sacrifices for the building of the wall.
But the god whose fame is known far as Dawn spreads her
light deserves the rebuke administered by Zeus for his pettiness
of spirit. An ordinary local <i>genius</i>, ‘some god far lesser than
he in work and will,’ might justly wax wrathful at the neglect
of his more limited prerogatives. Yet even so the wall was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
doomed to endure no long time. Then as now the divine law
ran, ‘An ye devote not hecatombs, no wall hath sure foundation.’</p>

<p>In this passage there is of course no suggestion of a local
<i>genius</i> in animal shape; the anthropomorphic tendency of Homeric
religion was too strong to admit of that. But since we know from
Theophrastus’ sketch of the superstitious man and from other
sources that in the classical age <i>genii</i> of houses and temples were
believed to appear in the form of snakes, we may without hesitation
assign the same belief to earlier ages. Such a superstition could
not in the nature of things have sprung up after an anthropomorphic
conception of the gods dominated all religion, but must
necessarily have been a survival from pre-classical and pre-Homeric
folklore.</p>

<p>But, though Homer speaks of the <i>genius</i> only as a ‘lesser god’
without further description, he implies clearly that the present
custom of doing sacrifice to such a being for the foundation of any
building was then in existence. Did the sacrifice ever involve
human victims? A positive and certain answer cannot, I suppose,
be made; but bearing in mind the many ancient traditions of
human sacrifice in Greece and even the occasional continuance
of the practice in the most civilised and enlightened age<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> I cannot
doubt it. I suspect that, if we could obtain an earlier version of
the story of Iphigenia than has come down to us, we should find
that the wrath of Artemis had no part in it, but that human
sacrifice was offered to the Winds or other <i>genii</i> of the air&mdash;that
the ‘maiden’s blood’ was, in the words of Aeschylus, ‘a sacrifice
to stay the winds<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>,’ ‘a charm to lull the Thracian blasts<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>,’ that and
nothing more. But a story still more strongly evidential of the
custom is told by Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>. In the war between Messenia and
Sparta, when the Messenians had been reduced to extremities, ‘they
decided to evacuate all their many towns in the open country and
to establish themselves on Mount Ithome. Now there was there
a town of no great size, which Homer, they say, includes in the
Catalogue&mdash;“Ithome steep as a ladder.” In this town they
established themselves, extending its ancient circuit so as to
provide a stronghold large enough for all. And apart even from
the fortifications the place was strong; for Ithome is as high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
as any mountain in the Peloponnese and, where the town lay, was
particularly inaccessible. They determined also to send an envoy
to Delphi,’ who brought them back the following oracle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A maiden pure unto the nether powers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chosen by lot, of lineage Aepytid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye shall devote in sacrifice by night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if ye fail thereof, take ye a maid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en from a man of other race as victim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An he shall give her willingly to slay.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the story goes on to tell how in the end Aristodemus devoted
his own daughter, and she became the accepted victim.</p>

<p>Here Pausanias, it will be noticed, does not give any reason
for the sacrifice being required. But three points in his narrative
are highly suggestive. The story of the sacrifice follows
immediately upon the mention of the building of new fortifications&mdash;and
the foundation of what was to be practically a
new city was eminently a question on which to consult the
Delphic oracle; the powers to whom sacrifice is ordered are
designated merely as <span class="greek">νέρτεροι δαίμονες</span>, the nearest equivalent
in ancient Greek to <i>genii</i>; and the time of the sacrifice is to be
night, when, according to modern belief, <i>genii</i> are most active. If
then modern superstition can ever teach us anything about ancient
religion, it supplies the clue here. The maiden was to be sacrificed
to the <i>genii</i> of Mount Ithome to ensure the stability of the new
fortifications.</p>

<p>Now if my interpretation of this story is right and the practice
of human sacrifice to <i>genii</i> was known in ancient Greece, the
transition from the worship of <i>genii</i> in the form of snakes or
dragons to the worship of tutelary heroes or gods in human
likeness is readily explained on the analogy of a similar transition
in modern belief. What was originally the victim was mistaken
for the genius. The same confusion of thought, by which, in one
version of ‘the Bridge of Arta,’ the <i>genius</i> in person demands
a human victim and yet afterwards the victim speaks of herself
as becoming the <i>genius</i> of the bridge, can be detected even in the
oracle given to the Messenians. ‘If ye fail to find a maid of the
blood of the Aepytidae,’ it said, ‘ye may take the daughter of a man
of other lineage, provided that he give her willingly for sacrifice.’
Why the condition? Why ‘willingly’ only? Because, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
even the Delphic oracle halted between two opinions&mdash;between
the conception of the maiden as a victim to appease angry <i>genii</i>
and the belief that the dead girl herself would become the guardian-<i>daemon</i>
of the stronghold.</p>

<p>Let us read another story from Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>: ‘At the base of
Mount Cronius, on the north side (of the Altis at Olympia),
between the treasuries and the mountain, there is a sanctuary of
Ilithyia, and in it Sosipolis, a native <i>daemon</i> of Elis, is worshipped.
To Ilithyia they give the surname “Olympian,” and elect a priestess
to minister to her year by year. The old woman too who waits
upon Sosipolis is bound by Elean custom to chastity in her own
person, and brings water for the bathing of the god and serves
him with barley-cakes kneaded with honey. In the front part
of the temple, which is of double construction, is an altar of
Ilithyia, and entrance thereto is public; but in the inner part
Sosipolis is worshipped, and only the woman who serves the god
may enter, and she only with her head and face covered by a white
veil. And while she does so, maidens and married women wait in
the temple of Ilithyia and sing a hymn; incense of all sorts is
also offered to him, but no libations of wine. An oath also at the
sanctuary of Sosipolis is taken on very great occasions.</p>

<p>‘It is said that when the Arcadians had once invaded Elis, and
the Eleans lay encamped opposite to them, a woman came to the
generals of the Eleans, with a child at her breast, and said that,
though she was the mother of the child, she offered it, bidden
thereto by dreams, to fight on the side of the Eleans. And those
in command, trusting the woman’s tale, put the child in the forefront
of the army naked. Then the Arcadians came to the
attack, and lo! straightway the child was changed into a
serpent. And the Arcadians, dismayed at the sight, turned to
flight, and were pressed by the Eleans, who won a signal victory
and gave to the god the name of Sosipolis (“saviour of the state”).
And at the place where the serpent disappeared in the ground
after the battle they set up the sanctuary; and along with him
they took to worshipping Ilithyia, because she was the goddess
who had brought the boy into the world.’</p>

<p>Is this story complete, or did Pausanias’ informants suppress
one material point out of shame? How came a mortal infant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
to assume the form of a serpent which is proper only to
apparitions from the lower world? The missing episode is,
I believe, the sacrifice of the child, which having been offered
willingly became after death a <i>daemon</i> friendly to the Eleans
and fought, in the form of a serpent, on their side. Human
sacrifice before a battle was not unknown in ancient Greece<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>,
but by Pausanias’ time the inhabitants of Elis might well have
hesitated to impute to their forefathers so barbarous a custom,
and have modified the story by omitting even that incident
which alone could make it harmonise with ancient religious
ideas<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>.</p>

<p>A similar view has been taken of another story of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>,
also from Elis. ‘Oxylus (the king of Elis), they say, had two
sons Aetolus and Laias. Aetolus died before his parents and
was buried by them in a tomb which they caused to be made
exactly in the gate of the road to Olympia and the sanctuary
of Zeus. The cause of their burying him thus was an oracle
which forbade the corpse to be either within or without the
city. And up to my time the governor of the gymnasium still
makes annual offerings to Aetolus as a hero.’ Commenting
on this passage Dr Frazer<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> says, ‘The spirit of the dead man was
probably expected to guard the gate against foes.... It is possible
that in this story of the burial of Aetolus in the gate we have
a faded tradition of an actual human sacrifice offered when the
gate was built.’ Certainly the facts that Aetolus was young and
that he was not head of the royal house make his elevation to the
rank of tutelary hero after death difficult to understand on any
other hypothesis; and it should be noted too that the oracle,
in obedience to which his tomb was made in the gateway,
probably came, as the preceding context suggests, from Delphi,
that same shrine which was responsible for the sacrifice of
Aristodemus’ daughter in the Messenian war.</p>

<p>Thus there is some probability that in ancient, as in modern,
Greece the <i>genius</i> was sometimes superseded by the victim offered
to him, but bequeathed to his successor something of his own
character. The victim, now become a hero, manifested himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
in the old-established guise of a serpent, and, if we may judge
from the case of Sosipolis at Olympia, continued to be fed with
honey-cakes, the same food which had been considered the appropriate
diet for the original snake-<i>genii</i> such as those dwelling in the
Erechtheum. But, when once the transition of worship was well
advanced, the power to assume serpent-form was naturally extended
to all tutelary heroes and even to gods; to have been sacrificed was
no longer the sole qualifying condition. The hero Cychreus went
to the help of the Athenians at Salamis in the form of a serpent<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>.
Two serpents were the incarnations of the heroes Trophonius and
Agamedes at the oracle of Lebadea<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>. Amphiaraus was represented
by a snake on the coins of Oropus. An archaic relief of the sixth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in the Museum of Sparta, to which Miss Harrison
has recently called attention, represents ‘a male and a female
figure seated side by side on a great throne-like chain.... Worshippers
of diminutive size approach with offerings&mdash;a cock and
some object that may be a cake, an egg, or a fruit.... It is clear
that we have ... representations of the dead, but the dead conceived
of as half-divine, as heroized&mdash;hence their large size as compared
with that of their worshipping descendants. They are <span class="greek">κρείττονες</span>,
“Better and Stronger Ones.” The artist of the relief is determined
to make his meaning clear. Behind the chair, equal in height to
the seated figures, is a great curled snake, but a snake strangely
fashioned. From the edge of his lower lip hangs down a long
beard, a decoration denied by nature. The intention is clear;
he is a <i>human</i> snake, the vehicle, the incarnation of the dead
man’s ghost<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>.’</p>

<p>In this relief the offerings depicted also are, I think, no less
instructive than the bearded snake. If we may suppose that the
somewhat indeterminate object, cake, egg, or fruit, was intended
for a honey-cake, the offerings combine that which was the
accustomed food of snake-<i>genii</i> in ancient times with a cock, the
victim most frequently sacrificed to the same <i>genii</i> at the present
day.</p>

<p>Of gods, Asclepius, perhaps because he began life as a hero,
was most frequently represented in serpent-form. It was in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
guise that he came to Sicyon, Epidaurus Limera, and Rome<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>;
and in later times Lucian tells a humorous tale of how an
impostor effected by trickery a supposed re-incarnation of Asclepius
in snake-form before the very eyes of the people out of
whose superstitions he made a living and indeed a fortune<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>.
Here again, if we may argue from modern custom, the serpent-form
carried with it the traditional offering of a ‘cock to Asclepius.’
But other gods too had sometimes their attendant snakes, as had
Asclepius at Epidaurus; and in every case it is likely that the
particular god had originally dispossessed a primitive snake-<i>genius</i>,
but inherited from him and retained for a time in local cults the
form of a snake; until, as the conception of the gods became more
and more anthropomorphic, the snake ceased to be a manifestation
of the god himself and became merely his minister or his symbol.
Even Zeus himself, under the title of Meilichios, is proved by two
reliefs found at the Piraeus to have been figured for a time by his
worshippers as a snake<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.</p>

<p>In many such cases doubtless the substitution of the cult of
a new and named god for that of a primitive and nameless <i>genius</i>
explains adequately the incomer’s inheritance and temporary
retention of the snake-form; but in the case of tutelary heroes,
above all, the analogy of modern folk-lore, in which the human
victim is sometimes erroneously elevated to the rank of guardian-<i>genius</i>,
supplies, I think, the right clue to the process by which in
ancient times the snake came to be the recognised incarnation of
the spirits of dead men and heroes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>genii</i> of water, to whom we now turn, are sometimes
imagined in the form of dragons or of bulls, but more often by
far in human or quasi-human shape. An exception to the general
rule must of course be made in the case of the <i>genii</i> of bridges,
if, as I suppose, they were originally identical with the <i>genii</i> of
those rivers which the bridges span; for these, as I have said, are
usually dragons. But if in this case there is a difference in outward
appearance, there is a general agreement at any rate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
characteristics; for the <i>genii</i> of water are no less hostile to man
than those who demand human sacrifice as the price of their
permission to build a bridge.</p>

<p>At Kephalóvryso in Aetolia the <i>genii</i> of a river were described
to me as red, grinning devils who might often be seen sitting in the
bed of the stream beneath the water. They were believed to mate
with <i>Lamiae</i> who infested several caves on the bank of the river;
and together these two kinds of monster would feed on the
bodies of men whom they had dragged into the river and
drowned.</p>

<p>But far more frequently the <i>genii</i> of water, and especially of
wells, appear in the form of Arabs (<span class="greek">Ἀράπηδες</span>), and may be seen
sometimes smoking long pipes in the depths. They have the
power of transforming themselves into any shape. At one time
they assume dragon-form and terrorise a whole country side;
at another they adopt the guise of a lovely maiden weeping
beside a well, and, on pretence of having dropped into it a ring,
induce gallant and unwary men to descend to their death<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>; for
when once the Arab has entrapped them in his well he feeds
upon them or smokes them in lieu of tobacco in his pipe.</p>

<p>How Arabs have come to find a place among the <i>genii</i> of
modern Greece is a question which must be answered in one of
two ways. Either during the Turkish domination of Greece the
Arab slaves, who were to be found in every wealthy house, were
suspected by the Christian population of possessing magical
powers, and from being magicians were elevated, as the <i>Striges</i>
often were in mediaeval and modern Greece, to the rank of demons;
or else they are another example of the transmutation of victims
into <i>genii</i>. For several reasons I incline to the latter explanation.
First, these Arabs are most commonly associated with wells, and
for the sinking of a well, no less than for the erection of a building
or the opening of a quarry, a victim would naturally be required.
Secondly, an animal victim is for choice of a black or dark colour,
and, by parity of reasoning, among human victims an Arab (or
other man of dark colour, for the word Arab is used popularly of
all such) would be preferable to a white man. Thirdly, it was
reported from Zacynthos only a generation ago that a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
feeling still existed there in favour of sacrificing a Mohammedan
or a Jew at the foundation of important bridges and other buildings<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>;
and there is a legend of a black man having been actually
immured in the bridge of an aqueduct near Lebadea in Boeotia<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>.
Lastly, I heard from a shepherd belonging to Chios the story
of a house in that island haunted by beings whom he called
indifferently Arabs<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and <i>vrykólakes</i>. He himself had been mad
for eight months from the shock of seeing them, and four of his
friends who visited the house to discover the cause of his disaster
were similarly afflicted. The demons were finally laid to rest by
an old man driving a flock of goats through the house<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>. Now
<i>vrykólakes</i>, with whom I shall deal at length later on, are persons
resuscitated after death who issue from their graves; and among
those who are predisposed to such reappearance are men who
have met with a violent death. The identification therefore of
Arabs with <i>vrykólakes</i> in this story suggests that an Arab victim
sacrificed at the foundation of some building might become the
<i>genius</i> of it&mdash;not in this case the beneficent guardian of it, but
owing to his violent death a malicious and hurtful monster.
On this evidence I incline to the view that the Arabs who now
form a class of <i>genii</i> were originally the human victims preferred
at the sinking of wells&mdash;a piece of engineering, it must be remembered,
of first-rate importance in a country as dry as Greece&mdash;and
that, when once these <i>genii</i> had become associated with water, the
popular imagination soon assigned them to rivers and natural
springs no less than to wells.</p>

<p>The <i>genii</i> of rivers sometimes appear also in the shape of bulls,
though as I have already remarked this type of <i>genius</i> is far more
commonly associated with churches. Possibly in some cases the
fact that the church was built in the neighbourhood of some
sacred spring, whose miraculous virtue was of older date and repute
than Christianity, first caused the transference; but at any rate
some rivers still retain this type of <i>genius</i>, the type under which
river gods were regularly represented in ancient times. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
connexion a story entitled ‘the ox-headed man<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>’ and narrated to
me at Goniá in the island of Santorini deserves mention.</p>

<p>A princess and a poor girl once agreed that when they were
married, if of their respective first-born the one should be a boy
and the other a girl, these two should be married. Now, as it
chanced, princess and peasant-maid were both wed on the same
day, but for a long time both remained childless. Then at last
they prayed to the Panagia, the princess for a child even if it
were but a girl, the peasant for a son even if he were but half
a man; and their prayers were answered; for the poor woman
bore a son with the head of an ox, while the princess was blest
with a beautiful daughter.</p>

<p>When the two children were grown up, the poor woman went
one day to claim the fulfilment of the agreement, and the princess,
or rather now the queen, went to ask her husband. He however
objected to the suitor on the grounds of personal appearance, and
stipulated that he should at least first perform certain feats to
prove his worthiness. The first task was to build a palace of
pearls, the second to plant the highest mountain of Santorini
(<span class="greek">μέσο βουνί</span>, ‘central mountain,’ as it is locally called) with trees,
and the third to border all the roads of the island with flowers. For
each labour one single night was the limit of time. But the ox-headed
man was equal to the work, and having accomplished
it came riding on a white horse to claim his bride. The king
however, who had imposed these three labours in full assurance
that the unseemly suitor would fail, now flatly refused to abide by
his promise, and the man retired disconsolate and disappeared
none knew whither.</p>

<p>The young princess was much affected at the unfair treatment
of her lover, and each day she grew more and more melancholy.
But finally she hit upon a means of cheering herself. She proposed
to her father that they should leave the palace and start
an inn, not for money, but for the sake of the amusement to be
derived from the stories and witty sayings of the guests. The king
consented, and the inn was set up.</p>

<p>Now one day a boy who had been fishing dropped his rod into
the river, and having dived in after it came to a flight of stairs at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
the bottom. Having walked down forty steps, he entered a large
room where sat the ox-headed man, who talked with him
and told him that he was waiting there for a princess who came
not. The boy then returned without hurt, and on his way home
had to pass the inn. Having turned in there, he was asked by
the princess to tell her something amusing. He replied however
that he knew no stories, but would recount to her an adventure
which had just befallen him. In the course of the story the
princess recognised that what the boy called the <i>genius</i> of the
river (<span class="greek">τὸ στοιχειὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ</span>) could be no other than her
lover, and having been straightway conducted to the spot, found
and married the ox-headed man, and in his palace under the river
lived happily ever afterwards&mdash;“but” (as Greek fairy-tales often
end) “we here much more happily.”</p>

<p>It is curious that Santorini of all places should be the
source of this story; for the island does not possess a stream.
Locally however certain gullies by which the island is intersected
are known as rivers (<span class="greek">ποταμοί</span>)<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>, and after unusually heavy rain
they might perhaps form torrents; at any rate one known as
‘the evil river’ (<span class="greek">ὁ κακὸς ποταμός</span>) is frequently mentioned in
popular traditions as a real river. Possibly the tradition is
accurate; for the volcanic nature of the island would readily
account for the disappearance of a single stream<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>. But the
importance of the story lies in the mention of an ox-headed
man as <i>genius</i> of a river. The fact that he is made the son of
a peasant-woman need not concern us; the first part of the story
is probably adapted from some other folk-tale with a view to
account for the wooing of a princess by so ill-favoured a suitor.
In the latter part we have a more ancient <i>motif</i>, the wedding of
a mortal maid with a river-god. If only it were mentioned in this
tale that, besides the power of performing miraculous tasks, the
bull-headed man had the faculty, which modern <i>genii</i> possess, of
transforming himself into other shapes, we should have a complete
parallel (save in the princess’ willingness to wed) with the wooing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
of Deianira by the river-god Achelous; “for he,” says she, “in
treble shapes kept seeking me from my sire, coming now in true
bull-form, now as a coiling serpent of gleaming hues, anon with
human trunk and head of ox<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>.” The <i>genii</i> of rivers have not, it
would seem, changed their forms and attributes, save for the
admission of Arabs to their number, from the age of Sophocles
to this day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The third class of <i>genius</i> which we have to notice is terrestrial,
inhabiting mountains, rocks, caves, and any other grim and desolate
places. These <i>genii</i> are the most frequent of all, and are known as
dragons. Not of course that all dragons are terrestrial; the
dragon-form has already been mentioned among the forms proper
to the <i>genii</i> of springs and wells, and also as a shape assumed at
will by the Arabs who more frequently occupy those haunts. But
terrestrial <i>genii</i>, in whatever place they make their lair&mdash;and no
limit can be set to such places&mdash;are far most commonly pictured
as dragons; and I have therefore preferred to speak of the dragons
in general here, rather than among the <i>genii</i> of either buildings
or water.</p>

<p>The term <span class="greek">δράκος</span> or <span class="greek">δράκοντας</span><a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> indicates to the Greek peasant
a monster of no more determinate shape than does the word
‘dragon’ to ourselves. The Greek word however differs, and
has always differed, from the English form of it in one respect,
namely that it is often employed in a strict and narrow sense to
denote a ‘serpent’ as distinguished from a small snake (in modern
Greek <span class="greek">φίδι</span>, i.e. <span class="greek">ὀφίδιον</span>, the diminutive of the ancient <span class="greek">ὄφις</span>). On
the other hand, a Greek ‘dragon,’ in the widest sense of the term,
is sometimes distinctly anthropomorphic in popular stories, and is
made to boil kettles and drink coffee without any sense of impropriety.
It is in fact only from the context of a story that it
is possible to determine in what shape the dragon is imagined;
in general it is neither flesh nor fowl nor good red devil; heads
and tails, wings and legs, teeth and talons, are assigned to it in
any number and variety; it breathes air and fire indifferently;
it sleeps with its eyes open and sees with them shut; it makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
war on men and love to women; it roars or it sings, and there
is little to choose between the two performances; for the lapse
of centuries, it seems, has in no wise mellowed its voice<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>. The
stories of the common-folk are full of these monsters’ savagery
and treachery<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>; for it is the dragons, above all other supernatural
beings, who provide the wandering hero of the fairy-tales with
befitting adventures and tests of prowess.</p>

<p>A common <i>motif</i> of such stories is provided by the belief that
dragons are the guardians of buried treasure. When a man in
a dream has had revealed to him the whereabouts of buried
treasure, his right course is to go to the spot without breathing
to anyone a hint of his secret, and there to slay a cock or other
animal such as is offered at the laying of foundation-stones, in
order to appease the <i>genius</i> (which is almost always a dragon,
though an Arab is occasionally substituted) before he ventures to
disturb the soil. This is the very superstition which Artemidorus
had in mind when he interpreted dreams about dragons to denote
‘wealth and riches, because dragons make their fixed abode over
treasures<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>.’ Having complied with these conditions the digger
may hope to bring gold to light; but if he have previously betrayed
to anyone his expectations or have failed to propitiate the
dragon, the old proverb is fulfilled, <span class="greek">ἄνθρακες ὁ θησαυρός</span><a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>, his
treasure turns out to be but ashes (<span class="greek">κάρβουνα</span>).</p>

<p>The guardianship likewise of gardens wherein flow ‘immortal
waters’ or grows ‘immortal fruit’ is the province of dragons. In
Tenos a typical story concerning them is told in several versions<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>.
The hero of them all bears the name of <span class="greek">Γιαννάκης</span> or ‘Jack’
(a familiar diminutive of <span class="greek">Ἰωάννης</span>, ‘John’)&mdash;a name commonly
given in Greek fairy-tales to the performer of Heraclean feats.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
The hero who, after discovering that his youngest sister is a
Strigla, has fled with his mother, the queen, from the palace
where they were in imminent danger of being devoured<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>, comes
to a castle occupied by forty dragons. The prince straightway
attacks them single-handed and slays, so he thinks, all of them,
but in reality one has only feigned to be dead and so escapes to
a hole beneath the castle, of which Jack now becomes the
master. The remaining dragon however ventures forth, when the
prince is gone out to the chase, and makes love to the queen, and
after a while dragon and queen knowing that the prince would be
incensed at their intrigue conspire to kill him. To this end the
queen on her son’s return pretends to be ill, and in response to his
enquiries tells him that the only thing that can heal her is
‘immortal water<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>,’ which, as her paramour, the dragon, knows,
is to be found only in a distant garden guarded by one or more
other dragons. The prince at once undertakes to obtain the
desired remedy, and is directed by a witch (who in some versions
appears as the impersonation of his <span class="greek">τύχη</span> or ‘Fortune’) whither
to go and how to deal with the dragons. These accordingly he
slays or eludes, and so returns home unhurt bringing the immortal
water. Then once more the dragon and the queen take
counsel together, and the pretence of illness is repeated with
a demand this time for some immortal fruit or herb<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> known to
be guarded in the same way as the water; and once more the
prince sets out and circumvents the dragons in some new fashion.</p>

<p>Between such stories and the ancient fable of Heracles’
journey to the land of the Hesperides in search of the golden
apples, and of his victory over the guardian-dragon Ladon, the
connexion is self-evident. Whether that connexion is one of
direct lineage, is less certain. More probably, I think, a form of
this same story was already current in an age to which the name
of Heracles was as unknown as that of the modern Jack; and
just as the story of Peleus and Thetis became the classical example<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
of the winning of a nymph to wife by a mortal man<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>, so the myth,
by which the exploit of bearing off wonderful fruit from the
custody of a dragon was numbered among the labours of Heracles,
is nothing more than the authorised version, so to speak, of
a fairy-tale that might have been heard of winter-nights in
Greek cottage-homes any time between the Pelasgian and the
present age.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Daemons of the air, the fourth class of <i>genius</i> which we have
to consider, have been acknowledged ever since the time of Hesiod
and doubtless from a period far anterior to that. In his theology
it was the lot of the first race of men in the golden age to become
after death daemons ‘clothed in air and going to and fro through
all the world’ as good guardians of mortal men. But the goodness
which Hesiod attributes to the <i>genii</i> of the air was never,
I suspect, an essential trait in their character. In Hesiod it is
a corollary of the statement that they are the spirits of men who
belonged to the golden age; but there is no reason to suppose
that the common-folk ever regarded them as more beneficent than
other gods and daemons. At any rate at the present day the
<span class="greek">ἀερικά</span>, or <i>genii</i> of the air, are no better disposed towards mankind
than any other supernatural beings.</p>

<p>Of this class as a whole little can be said. The word <span class="greek">ἀερικό</span>
is applied to almost any apparition too vague and transient to
be more clearly defined. It suggests something ‘clothed in air,’
something less tangible, less discernible, than most of the beings
whom the peasant recognises and fears. The limits of its usage
are hard to fix. It may properly include a Nereid whose passing
through the air is the whirlwind, and it will equally certainly
exclude a callicantzaros or a dragon. Yet even the Nereids are
more substantial than the <i>genii</i> of the air in their truest form;
for the assaults of Nereids upon men and women are made, as
we have seen, from without<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>, while <i>genii</i> of the air are more often
supposed to ‘possess’ men in the same way as do devils, and to
be liable to exorcism.</p>

<p>But, if the class as a whole is too vague and shadowy in the
popular imagination to be capable of exact description, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
division of it is more clearly defined and has a generally acknowledged
province of activity. These particular aërial <i>genii</i>
are known as Telonia (<span class="greek">τελώνια</span> or, more rarely, <span class="greek">τελωνεῖα</span>). They
cannot claim equal antiquity with some of their fellows, for they
are, it would seem, a by-product of Christianity, with a certain
accretion however of pagan superstition.</p>

<p>The origin of the name Telonia is not in dispute. It means
frankly and plainly ‘custom-houses.’ Such is the bizarre materialism
of the Greek imagination that the soul in its journeys
no less than the body is believed to encounter the embarrassment
of custom-houses. An institution which of all things mundane
commands least sentiment and sympathy has actually found
a place in popular theology. Many of the people indeed at the
present day, as I know from enquiry, have ceased to connect
their two usages of the word; but others accept as reasonable
the belief that the soul in its voyage after death up from the
earth to the presence of God must bear the scrutiny of aërial
customs-officers.</p>

<p>But, apart from modern belief, the apotheosis of the <i>douane</i>
is amply proved by passages cited by Du Cange<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> from early
Christian authors. ‘Some spirits,’ says one<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>, ‘have been set on
the earth, and some in the water, and others have been set in the
air, even those that are called “aërial customs-officers” (<span class="greek">ἐναέρια
Τελώνια</span>).’ Another<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> speaks of ‘the Judge and the prosecutions
by the toll-collecting spirits.’ Yet another<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> explains the belief
in fuller detail: ‘as men ascend, they find custom-houses
guarding the way with great care and obstructing the soaring
souls, each custom-house examining for one particular sin, one
for deceit, another for envy, another for slander, and so on in
order, each passion having its own inspectors and assessors<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>.’
Again a prayer for the use of the dying contains the same idea:
‘Have mercy on me, all-holy angels of God Almighty, and save
me from all evil Telonia, for I have no works to weigh against
my wrong-doings<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>.’ Appeal in support of this belief was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
even to the authority of Christ as given in the words, ‘Thou fool,
this night they require thy soul of thee<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>,’ where the commentators
explained the vague plural as implying some such subject as ‘toll-collectors’
or ‘custom-house officers<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>.’</p>

<p>But the belief does not stop here. One does not pass the
custom-houses of this world, or at any rate of Greece, without
some expenditure in duty or in <i>douceur</i>; and the same apparently
holds true of the celestial custom-houses. Hence in some places
the belief has generated a practice, or, to speak more exactly,
has breathed a new spirit into the old practice of providing the
dead with money. My view of the origin of this practice has
already been explained; I have given reasons for holding that
the coin placed in the mouth of the dead was simply a charm
to prevent evil spirits from entering, or the soul from re-entering,
into the body, and that the interpretation of the custom, according
to which the coin was the fee of the ferryman Charon, was of
comparatively late date. At the present day Charon in the <i>rôle</i>
of ferryman is almost forgotten; but in his place the Telonia
seem locally to have become the recipients of the fee, and the
old custom has thus received a second and equally erroneous
explanation.</p>

<p>This may have been the idea in the mind of my informant
who vaguely said that a coin placed in the mouth of the dead
was ‘good because of the aërial beings<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>.’ If the particular aërial
beings whom he had in mind were the Telonia, he no doubt
thought of the coin as a fee payable to them, though in that case
it is somewhat strange that he should not have used the name
which actually denotes their toll-collecting functions.</p>

<p>But from other sources at any rate comes evidence of a less
ambiguous kind that the idea of paying the Telonia for passage
is, or has been, a real motive in the minds of the peasantry. In
Chios (where however the object actually placed in the mouth
of the dead is clearly understood as a precaution against a devil
entering the body) it is believed that the soul after death remains
for forty days in the neighbourhood of its old habitation, the body,
and then making its way to Hades has to pass the Telonia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Happy the soul that makes its voyage on Friday, for then the
activities of the Telonia (who in the conception of the islanders
are clearly evil spirits and not, as sometimes, the ministers of
God) are restrained. But, to appease the Telonia and to ensure
the safe passage of the soul, money is distributed to the poor<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>.
The same usage obtains also at Sinasos in Cappadocia, and there
the money so distributed is actually called <span class="greek">τελωνιακά</span>, ‘duty paid
at the customs<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>.’ The fact that in both these cases the money
is now given in alms instead of being buried with the body is
clearly a result of Christian influence; before that change was
effected, it is reasonably likely that the widely-known practice
of placing a coin in the mouth of the dead was explained in some
places, though erroneously, by the belief that the dead must pay
their way through the aërial custom-houses. The term <span class="greek">περατίκι</span>,
‘passage-money,’ by which, in the neighbourhood of Smyrna, is
denoted the coin still in that district buried with the dead, has
reference possibly to the same Telonia rather than to Charon<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>.</p>

<p>Another and wholly different aspect of the Telonia concerns
the living and not the dead, while it still exhibits them as true
<i>genii</i> of the air. Any striking phenomena of the heavens at
night, such as shooting-stars or comets, are believed to be manifestations
of the Telonia<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>; but most dreaded of all is the
phenomenon known to us as St Elmo’s light, the flame that
sometimes flickers in time of storm about the mast-head and
yards. This light, the Greek sailor thinks, portends an immediate
onset of malevolent aërial powers, whom he straightway tries to
scare away by every means in his power, by invocation of saints
and incantation against the demons, by firing of guns, and, best of
all, by driving a black-handled knife (which is in the Cyclades
thought doubly efficacious if an onion has recently been peeled
with it) into the mast. For he no longer discriminates as did the
Greek mariner of old; then the appearance of two such flames was
greeted with gladness as a manifestation of the Dioscuri, the
saviours from storm and tempest, and evil was portended only if
there appeared a single flame, the token of Helena<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>, who wrecked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
as surely as her twin brothers guarded; now the phenomenon in
any form bodes naught but ill. This change is probably due to
Christian influences; the seaman no longer looks to any pagan
power for succour in time of peril; he accounts St Nicholas his
friend and saviour; and the Telonia, who in this province of their
activity represent the older order of deities, have become by
contrast man’s enemies.</p>

<p>Other vague and incorrect usages of the term Telonia are also
recorded. Sometimes it may be heard as a synonym for <span class="greek">δαιμόνια</span>,
any non-Christian deities. In Myconos it is said to have been
applied to the <i>genii</i> of springs<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. In Athens men used to speak of
Telonia of the sea, who like the Callicantzari were abroad only from
Christmas until the blessing of the waters at Twelfth-night; and
during this time ships were wont to be kept at anchor and secure
from their attacks<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>. A belief is also mentioned by Pouqueville<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>, in
a very confused passage, that children who die unbaptised become
Telonia; but the statement is corroborated by Bernhard Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>,
who adduces information of the same belief existing in Zacynthos.
The idea at the root of it probably was that unbaptised children
could not pass the celestial customs, and were detained there on
their road to the other world in order to assist in obstructing the
passage of other souls. But these are local variations of the main
belief, and, so far as I can see, are of little importance. In general
the Telonia are a species of aërial <i>genius</i>, and their two activities
consist in the collecting of dues from departed souls and assaults
upon mariners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There remain only for consideration the <i>genii</i> of human
beings, or the attendant spirits to whom is committed in some
way the guidance of men’s lives. To some of them the name
<i>genius</i> (i.e. <span class="greek">στοιχειό</span>) would hardly perhaps be extended by the
peasants; but they all bear the same kind of relation towards
men, and may therefore conveniently be grouped together for
discussion.</p>

<p>The best example which I know of an acknowledged <i>genius</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
attached to a man is in a story in Hahn’s collection<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>, which tells
of an old wizard whose life was bound up with that of a ten-headed
snake which lived beneath a threshing-floor. Here the monstrous
nature of the <i>genius</i> is doubtless intended to match the character
of the wizard; ordinary men, unversed in magic, may have <i>genii</i>
of a less complex pattern. Thus the snake which so commonly
acts as <i>genius</i> to a house is also in many cases regarded as the
<i>genius</i> of the head or some other member of the household. When
therefore the death-struggle of any person is prolonged, this is
sometimes set down to the unwillingness of the <i>genius</i> to permit
his death; and in extreme cases of protracted agony recourse has
before now been had to a priest, who, entering the sick man’s
room alone, reads a special prayer for the sufferer’s release, and by
virtue of this solemn office causes the house-snakes, who are pagan
<i>genii</i>, to burst<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>. With their disruption of course the soul of the
dying man is at once set free.</p>

<p>But the guardian spirits of whom the peasants most commonly
speak belong to the <i>personnel</i> of Christian theology or demonology,
and are therefore not actually numbered among <i>genii.</i> These are
angels, two of whom are allotted to each man, the one good (<span class="greek">ὁ καλὸς
ἄγγελος</span>) and the other bad (<span class="greek">ὁ κακὸς ἄγγελος</span>). But though the
designation <i>genius</i> is not applied to them, in functions angels and
<i>genii</i> do not differ. To them belongs the control of a man’s life,
the one guiding him in the way of righteousness, and the other
diverting him to the pitfalls of vice. Their presence is ever constant,
but seldom visible. Sometimes indeed, in stories at any rate,
we hear of the good angel appearing to a man and rewarding him
in his old age for a virtuous life<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>; and in general men born on
Saturday, <span class="greek">σαββατογεννημένοι</span>, are reputed to be <span class="greek">ἀλαφροστοίχει̯ωτοι</span><a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
and endowed with special powers of seeing and dealing with the
supernatural. But most commonly the power to see the guardian
angel is granted only to the dying, and the vision is a warning
that the end is near. So, when the gaze of a dying man becomes
abstracted and fixed, they say in some places <span class="greek">βλέπει τὸν ἄγγελό
του</span>, or in one word <span class="greek">ἀγγελοθωρεῖ</span><a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>, ‘he sees his angel,’ or again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
<span class="greek">ἀγγελοσκιάζεται</span><a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>, ‘he is terrified of an angel.’ In these expressions
it is not clear which of the two angels is intended; but, to
judge from other expressions, popular belief recognises the activity
of the one or the other according to the peace or pain of the
death. ‘He is borne away by an angel,’ <span class="greek">ἀγγελοφορᾶται</span><a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>, suggests
a quiet passing, as of Lazarus who was carried by the angels into
Abraham’s bosom; while the word <span class="greek">ἀγγελομαχεῖ</span>, ‘he is fighting
with an angel,’ an expression used in Laconia of a protracted
death-struggle, and again <span class="greek">ἀγγελοκρούσθηκε</span><a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>, ‘he was stricken by
an angel,’ a term which denotes a sudden death, argue rather the
presence of the evil angel.</p>

<p>Another kind of <i>genius</i> sometimes associated with men is the
<span class="greek">ἴσκιος</span> (the modern form of <span class="greek">σκιά</span>), the ‘shadow’ personified. The
phrase <span class="greek">ἔχει καλὸ ἴσκιο</span>, ‘he has a good shadow,’ is used of a man
who enjoys good fortune, and he himself is described sometimes as
<span class="greek">καλοΐσκι̯ωτος</span><a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>, ‘good-shadowed,’ that is, ‘lucky.’ But apparently
a man may also get into trouble with this shadow no less than
with an angel. The word <span class="greek">ἰσκιοπατήθηκε</span>, ‘he has been trampled
upon by his shadow<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>,’ is used occasionally of a man who has been
stricken down by some sudden, but not necessarily fatal, illness
such as epilepsy or paralysis. This personification of the shadow as
<i>genius</i> is perhaps responsible in some measure for the fear which
the peasant feels of having the foundation-stone of a building laid
upon his shadow; but, as I have said above, the principle of
sympathetic magic will explain the cause of fear without this
supposition.</p>

<p>To these <i>genii</i> might reasonably be added the Fate (<span class="greek">ἡ Μοῖρα</span>
or, more rarely, <span class="greek">ἡ Τύχη</span>) of each individual. But these lesser
Fates, as well as the great Three, have already been discussed,
and there is nothing to add here save that by virtue of the close
connexion of each lesser Fate with the life of one man these too
might be numbered among <i>genii</i>.</p>

<p>The same belief in a guardian-deity presiding over each human
life is to be found throughout ancient Greek literature. In Homer
the name for such a <i>genius</i> is <span class="greek">Κὴρ</span> (at any rate if it be of an evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
sort), in later writers <span class="greek">δαίμων</span>&mdash;both of them vague terms which embrace
other kinds of deities as well, yet not so vague but that with
the aid of context we can readily discover in them the equivalent
of the ‘guardian-angel’ or other modern <i>genius</i>. From Homer
onwards the word <span class="greek">λαγχάνειν</span> is regularly used of the allotment of
each human life from the moment of birth to one of these
guardians, and the belief in their attendance upon men throughout,
and even after, life seems to have had general acceptance. In
the <i>Iliad</i> the wraith of Patroclus is made to speak of the hateful
<i>Ker</i> to whom he was allotted at the hour of birth<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>, and the <i>Ker</i>
here mentioned is not, I think, merely fate in the abstract but as
truly a person as that baneful <i>Ker</i> of battle and carnage ‘who wore
about her shoulders a robe red with the blood of heroes<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>.’ After
Homer the word <span class="greek">δαίμων</span> is preferred, but there is no change in the
idea. The famous saying of Heraclitus, <span class="greek">ἦθος ἀνθρώπῳ δαίμον</span>,
‘the god that guides man’s lot is character,’ is in no wise dark,
but Plato throws even clearer light upon the popular belief in
guardian-<i>daemons</i>. ‘It is said that at each man’s death his
<i>daemon</i>, the <i>daemon</i> to whom he had been allotted for his lifetime,
has the task of guiding him to some appointed place<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>,’
where the souls of men must assemble for judgement. Here
the words ‘it is said’ indicate the popular source of the doctrine;
and this is confirmed by another passage in which Plato<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> protests
against the fatalism involved in the allotment of souls to particular
<i>daemons</i>, and prefers to hold that the soul may choose its own
guardian. Again in a fragment of Menander there is a simple
statement of the belief in a form which robs fatalism of its
gloom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside each man a daemon takes his stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en at his birth-hour, through life’s mysteries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A guide right good<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there were others who did not take so cheerful a view, at
any rate of their own guardian-deities; ‘alas for the most cruel
<i>daemon</i> to whom I am allotted<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>’ is a complaint of a type by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
means rare in Greek literature, and the word <span class="greek">κακοδαίμων</span> came as
readily as <span class="greek">εὐδαίμων</span> to men’s lips<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>.</p>

<p>From these passages it is evident that in general each man
was believed to have one, and only one, attendant <i>genius</i>, and his
happiness or misery to depend on the character of the guardian
allotted to him by fate. But sometimes this injustice of destiny
was obviated by a belief similar to the modern belief in both good
and bad angels in attendance on each man. The comment of
Servius on Vergil’s line, ‘Quisque suos patimur manes<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>,’ sets forth
this view: ‘when we are born two <i>Genii</i> are allotted to us, one
who exhorts us to good, the other who perverts us to evil.’</p>

<p>As in modern so in ancient times these <i>genii</i> were rarely
visible to the men whom they guarded. The <i>genius</i> of Socrates,
which, like those of other men past and present, had been, so he
held, divinely appointed to wait upon him from his childhood
onward<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>, spoke to him indeed in a voice which he could hear<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
(just perhaps as the priestess of Delphi heard the voice of Apollo<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>),
but ever remained unseen.</p>

<p>The short sketch which has been given of the attitude of the
Greek peasantry towards the Christian Godhead and all the host
of assistant saints, and also the more detailed account of those
pagan deities or demons whom the common-folk’s awe, not unmingled
with affection, has preserved from oblivion through so
many centuries, have, I hope, justified the statement that the
religion of Greece both is now, and&mdash;if a multitude of coincidences
in the very minutiae of ancient and modern beliefs speak at all
for the continuity of thought&mdash;from the dawn of Greek history
onward through its brief bright noontide to its long-drawn dusk
and night illumined even now only by borrowed lights has ever
been, a form, and a little changed form, of polytheism.</p>

<p>Whatever be the merits and the demerits of such a religion in
contrast with the worship of one almighty God, most thinkers
will concede to it the property of bringing the divine element
within more easy comprehension of the majority of mankind.
Proper names, limited attributes, definite duties and spheres of
work&mdash;these give a starting point from which the peasant can set
out towards a conception of gods. He himself bears a name, he
himself has qualities, he himself performs his round of work; and
though his name be writ smaller than that of the being whom he
strives to imagine&mdash;though his virtues and perhaps his vices be
less pronouncedly white and black&mdash;though his daily task be
more trivial&mdash;yet in one and all of these things he stands on
common ground with his deities; they differ from him in degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
rather than in kind; he has but to picture a race of beings somewhat
stronger and somewhat nobler than the foremost of his own
fellow-men, and these whom he thus imagines are gods. A single
spirit omniscient and omnipotent is too distant, too inaccessible
from any known ground. Lack of the capacity to form or
to grasp lofty ideals carries with it at least the compensation
of closer intimacy with the supernatural and the divine.</p>

<p>It may therefore be expected that in the course of the intellectual
and spiritual development of any primitive people, the more
accurately they learn to measure their own imperfections and limitations,
and the more imaginatively they magnify the wisdom and
power of their gods, the wider and more impassable grows the chasm
that divides mortal from immortal, human from divine; communion
of man and god becomes less frequent, less direct. Such certainly was
the experience of the Greek nation in some measure; but, owing
probably to an innate and persistent vanity which at all times has
made the race blind to its own failings, that experience was less
acute than in the case of other peoples. There had been days
indeed when their gods walked the earth with men and counselled
them in troubles and fought in their battles; there had
been days when the chiefest of all the gods sought a hero’s aid
against his giant foes; there had been days when men and
women might aspire even to wedlock with immortals, and to
possess children half-divine. In those days too death was not
the only path by which the heavens or the house of Hades might
be gained. Kings and prophets, warriors and fair women passed
thither by grace of the gods living and unscathed; nay, even
personal skill or prowess emboldened minstrel and hero to match
themselves with the gods below, and wielding of club or sweeping
of lyre sufficed to open the doors for their return to earth.</p>

<p>But those days soon passed; men walked and spoke and held
open fellowship with the gods no more; the very poetry and
imagination of the Greek temperament so fast outstripped in
rapidity of development the growth of material or moral resources,
that the rift between their religious ideals and the realities of
their life and character ever widened, until the daily and familiar
intercourse of their ancestors with the gods seemed to them a
condition of life irretrievable and thenceforth impossible. This
result was observed and remarked by the Greeks themselves, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
the process by which it had come about was not agreed. To one
school of thought, it was the degeneracy of mankind through
successive ages&mdash;the golden age in which men lived as gods and
passed hence, as it were in sleep, to become spirits clothed in air,
administering upon earth the purposes of mighty Zeus&mdash;the silver
age wherein childhood was still long and innocent, and, though
men’s riper years brought cares and quarrels and indifference to
holy things, yet when the earth covered them they were called
blessed and received a measure of honour&mdash;the bronze age when
all men’s minds were set on war and their stalwart arms were
busy with brazen weapons, and by each other’s hands they were
sent down to the chill dark house of Hades and their names were
no more known&mdash;the age of heroes who were called half-divine,
who fought in the Theban and the Trojan wars, and when the
doom of death overtook them were granted a life apart from other
men in the islands of the blest, because they had been nobler and
more righteous than those of the age of bronze and had stemmed
for a time the current of degeneracy&mdash;the fifth age in which the
depravity of man grows apace and soon there will be nought but
discord between father and son, and no regard will be paid to
guest nor comrade nor brother, and children will slight their aged
parents, and the voice of gods will be unknown to them<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>&mdash;to one
school of thought, I say, it was simply and solely this decline of
the human race, swift and only once checked, that was held
accountable for their estrangement from the powers above them.</p>

<p>But such thinkers were in a minority. Humility and self-dissatisfaction
were and are qualities foreign to the ordinary
Greek. He observed the wide gulf that separated him from
those whom he worshipped, but without any sense of unworthiness,
without any depression of spirit. He was not despondent
over his own shortcomings and limitations, but was filled rather
with a larger complacency in the thought that, incapable though
he might be to reproduce actually in his own life and character
much of the beauty and nobility of his gods, he was so gifted in
mind and godlike in understanding, that in his moments of
highest imagination and most spiritual exaltation he could soar
to that loftier plane whereon was enacted all the divine life, and
could visualise his gods and feel the closeness of their presence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
The motive of the highest acts of Greek worship seems to have
been not the self-abasement of the worshipper and the glorification
of the worshipped, but rather an obliteration of the distinctions
between man and god, and a temporary attainment by the human
of spiritual equality and companionship with the divine. The
votary of Bacchus in his hours of wildest ecstacy enjoyed so
completely this sense of equality and of real union with the god,
that even to others it seemed fitting that he should be called by
the god’s own name<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>.</p>

<p>But the hours, in which the Greeks of the historical age
attained by a sort of religious frenzy such intimacy with their
gods as their ancestors were famed to have enjoyed all their life
long, were few and far between. The means of communion had
become in general less direct, less personal. Yet even so the
desire for communion continued unabated, and the belief in it
still pervaded every phase of life. Intellectual progress had curiously
little effect upon the dominant religious ideas. A strongly
conservative attachment to ancient tradition and custom was
strangely blended with that progressive spirit which made the
intellectual development of the Athenians unique in its swiftness,
as in its scope, among all peoples known to history. Their minds
welcomed new speculations, new doctrines; but their hearts clung
to the old unreasonable faith. Ancestral ideas remained for them
the sole foundation of religion. Each poet or philosopher in drama
or in dialogue, each man in his own heart, was free to build upon
it and to ornament his superstructure as he would; and his work
found a certain sanction in the appeal which it made to other
men’s sense of truth and of beauty. But for the foundation the
<i>fiat</i> of antiquity had been pronounced and was immutable. Plato’s
reasoned exposition of the soul’s immortality culminates in an
Apocalypse ratified by the old mythology; and a quotation from
Homer ever served to quash or to confirm the subtlest argument.</p>

<p>That the foundation-stone was not, in the estimate of reason,
well and truly laid, that the basis of religion was insecure, must
have been obvious to many. Pindar saw it, and, by refusing to
impute to the gods any deed or purpose which his own heart
condemned as ungodly, strove to repair its defects; Euripides too
saw it, and scoffed at those who would build on so unstable a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
base. But the mass of men, though they also must have seen,
were little troubled, it would seem, either to demolish or to repair.
They accepted the old beliefs and ceremonies because they were
sanctioned by the authority or the experience of past ages; and if
sober reasoning and criticism exposed flaws and inconsistencies
therein, what matter? They were, as they still are, a people
incapable of any mental equilibrium; the mood of the hour
swayed them now to emotions, now to reasonings; they did not
cultivate consistency; they could not sit still and preserve an
even balance between the passions of the heart and the judgements
of the intellect, but threw their whole selves into the one
scale, and the other for the moment was as vanity.</p>

<p>In the whole complex and irrational scheme of religion thus
accepted, nothing was more highly valued than the means by which
divine counsel was obtained for the conduct both of public and of
private affairs. Omens were regularly taken before battle, at the
critical moment when we should prefer to trust experience and
generalship. Oracles were consulted as to the sites for planting
colonies, in cases where a surveyor’s report might have seemed more
decisive. But the efficacy of these old methods of consulting the
gods went almost unchallenged. It seems seldom to have occurred
to men’s minds that those untoward signs in the victim’s entrails,
which perhaps delayed tactics on which victory depended, were
the symptoms of an internal disease and not the handiwork of
a deity, or that the inferior and ambiguous verse, in which the
gods condescended to give counsel, more often confused than confirmed
human judgement. Even of the philosophers, according to
Cicero<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>, two only, Xenophanes and Epicurus, went so far as to
deny the validity of all means of communion; and Socrates, for
all his questioning and testing of truth, obeyed without question
the whispered warnings of a <i>daemon</i>, and in deference to the
ambiguous exhortations of a vision spent some of his last days
in turning Aesop’s fables into verse, that so he might go into the
presence of the gods with his conscience clear. Thus, though men
no longer expected to look upon the faces or to hear the voices of
the gods, they still felt them to be close at hand, easy of access, ready
to counsel, to warn, to encourage; and the methods of communion,
in proportion as they stand condemned by reason, commend so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
much the more the steady faith of the people who used them and
never doubted their efficacy. The answer of the ordinary man to
those critics, who questioned the validity of divination merely
because they could not understand the way in which it operated,
is well expressed by Cicero: ‘It is a poor sort of cleverness to try
to upset by sophistry facts which are confirmed by the experience
of ages. The reason of those facts I cannot discover; the dark
ways of Nature, I suppose, conceal it from my view. God has not
willed that I should know the reason, but only that I should use
the means<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Greek nation saw many philosophies rise and fall, but
it clung always to the religion which it had inherited. The
doctrines of Plato and Aristotle, Zeno and Epicurus, became for
the Greek people as though they had never been; but the old
polytheism of the Homeric and earlier ages lived. Faith justified
by experience was a living force; the conclusions of reason a mere
fabrication. And an essential part of that polytheism which was
almost instinctive in the Greeks was their belief in the possibility
of close and frequent communion with their gods.</p>

<p>Now the means of communion between men and gods are
obviously twofold&mdash;the methods by which men make their communications
to the gods, and the methods by which the gods
make their communications to men. The former class of communications
involve for the most part questions or petitions; the
latter are mainly the responses thereto; and it would seem
natural to consider them in that order. But inasmuch as more
is known of the ancient methods by which the gods signified their
will to men than of the reverse process, it will be convenient first
to establish the unity of modern folklore with ancient religion in
this division of the subject, and afterwards to discuss how any
modern ideas concerning the means open to man of communicating
with the gods may bear upon the less known corresponding
department of ancient religion. For if we find that the theory no
less than the practice of divination, that is, of receiving and interpreting
divine messages, has been handed down from antiquity
almost unchanged, there will be a greater probability that, along
with the general modern system of sacrifices or offerings which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
accompany men’s petitions, a curious conception of human sacrifice
in particular which I once encountered is also a relic of
ancient religion.</p>

<p>The survival of divination then in its several branches first
claims our attention. The various modes employed are for the
most part enumerated by Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> in the passage where
Prometheus recounts the subjects in which he claimed to have
first instructed mankind: dreams and their interpretation; chance
words (<span class="greek">κληδόνες</span>) overheard, often conveying another meaning to
the hearer than that which the speaker intended; meetings on
the road (<span class="greek">ἐνόδιοι σύμβολοι</span>), where the person or object encountered
was a portent of the traveller’s success or failure in his errand;
auspices in the strict sense of the word, observations, that is, of the
flight and habits of birds; augury from a sacrificial victim, either
by inspection of its entrails or by signs seen in the fire in which
it was being consumed. To these arts Suidas<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> adds ‘domestic
divination’ (<span class="greek">οἰκοσκοπικόν</span>)&mdash;the interpretation of various trivial
incidents of domestic life&mdash;palmistry (<span class="greek">χειροσκοπικόν</span>), and divination
from the twitching of any part of the body (<span class="greek">παλμικόν</span>).
Finally of course there was direct inspiration (<span class="greek">μαντική</span>), either
temporary, as in an individual seer, or permanent, as at the oracle
of Delphi.</p>

<p>Whether the common-folk ever distinguished the comparative
values of these many methods of divination may well be doubted.
The Delphic oracle, I suspect, attained its high prestige more
because it was ready to supply immediately on demand a more
or less direct and detailed answer to a definite question, than
because personal inspiration was held to be in any way a surer
channel for divine communications than were other means of divination.
Some thinkers indeed, chiefly of the Peripatetic school<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>, were
inclined to draw distinctions between ‘natural’ and ‘skilled’
divination<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>. The ‘natural’ methods, including dreams and all
direct inspiration, were accepted by them; the ‘skilled’ methods,
those which required the services of a professional augur or interpreter,
were disallowed. But the division proposed was in itself
bad&mdash;for dreams do not by any means exclusively belong to the
first class, but probably in the majority of cases require interpre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>tation
by experts&mdash;and, apart from that consideration, the distinction
was the invention of a philosophical sect and not an
expression of popular feeling. There is nothing to show that
the common-folk, believing as they did in the practicability of
communion with their gods, esteemed one means of divination
as intrinsically more valuable than another.</p>

<p>Nor was there any logical reason for such discrimination.
Granted that there were gods superior to man in knowledge
and in power and also willing to communicate with him, no
restriction could logically be set upon the means of communication
which they might choose to adopt. There was no reason why
they should speak by the mouth of a priestess intoxicated with
mephitic vapours or disturb men’s sleep with visions rather than
use the birds as their messengers or write their commandment on
the intestines of a sacrificial victim.</p>

<p>A certain justification for accepting some means of divination,
such as intelligible dreams, and for suspecting others, might
certainly have been found in distrust of any human intermediary;
vagrant and necessitous oracle-mongers infested the country; and
even the priestess of Delphi, as history shows, was not always
superior to political and pecuniary considerations. But experience
of fraud did not apparently teach distrust; the fact that oracles
and other means of divination were undoubtedly often abused
did not cause the Greek people to reject the proper use of them;
down to this day all the chief methods of ancient divination
still continue. In some cases, we shall see, the modern employment
of such methods is a mere survival of ancient custom without
any intelligent religious motive; but in others there is abundant
evidence that the modern folk are still actuated by the feelings
which so dominated the lives of their ancestors&mdash;the belief in, and
the desire for, close and frequent communion with the powers above.</p>

<p>Direct inspiration is a gift which at the present day a man is
not inclined to claim for himself, though he will often attribute it
to another; for it implies insanity. But though the gift is not
therefore envied, it is everywhere respected. Mental derangement,
which appears to me to be exceedingly common among
the Greek peasants, sets the sufferer not merely apart from his
fellows but in a sense above them. His utterances are received
with a certain awe, and so far as they are intelligible are taken as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
predictions. He is in general secure from ill-treatment, and though
he do no work he is not allowed to want. The strangest case which
I encountered was that of a man, unquestionably mad, who
wandered from place to place and seemed to be known everywhere.
I met him in all three times, in Athens, in Tenos, and in Thessaly.
He had no fixed home, did no work, and was usually penniless;
but a wild manner, a rolling eye, and an extraordinary power of
conducting his part of a conversation in metrical, if not highly
poetical, form sufficed to obtain for him lodging, food, and clothing,
and even a free passage, it appeared, on the Greek coasting
steamers. Whether the long monologues in verse in which he
sometimes indulged were also improvisations, I could not of
course tell; but once to have heard and seen his delivery of
them was to understand why, among a superstitious people, he
passed for a prophet. He was a modern type of those old seers
whose name <span class="greek">μάντεις</span> was believed by Plato to have been formed
from the verb <span class="greek">μαίνεσθαι</span>, ‘to be mad’; his frenzy really gave the
appearance of inspiration.</p>

<p>Dreams furnish a more sober and naturally also a more general
means of communion with the gods; and the belief in them as a
channel of divine revelation is both firmly rooted and widely spread.
This indeed is only natural. The change from paganism to Christianity,
even if it had been more thorough and complete than it
actually has been, would probably not have affected this article of
faith. So long as a people believe in any one or more deities not
wholly removed from human affairs, it is logically competent for
them to regard their dreams as a special communication to them
from heaven; and Christianity, far from repudiating the old pagan
idea, confirmed it by biblical authority. The Greek Church, as
we shall see, has made effective use of it.</p>

<p>The degree of importance universally attached in old time to
dreams is too well known to all students of Greek literature to
call for comment. Artemidorus’ prefatory remarks to his <i>Oneirocritica</i>,
or ‘Treatise on the interpretation of dreams,’ and his criticism
of former exponents of the same science, would alone prove that
public interest in the subject must indeed have been great to stimulate
so serious and so large a literature. There is the same practical
evidence of a similar interest in modern Greece. Books of the same
nature are sought after and consulted no less eagerly now than then.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
A new edition of some <span class="greek">Μέγας Ὀνειροκρίτης</span>, or ‘Great Dream-interpreter,’
figures constantly in the advertisements of Athenian
newspapers, and the public demand for such works is undeniable.
In isolated homesteads, to which the Bible has never found its
way, I have several times seen a grimy tattered copy of such
a book preserved among the most precious possessions of the
family, and honoured with a place on the shelf where stood the
<i>icon</i> of the household’s patron-saint and whence hung his holy
lamp.</p>

<p>One of the pieces of information most frequently imparted to
men in dreams is the situation of some buried treasure. The
precautions necessary for unearthing it, namely complete reticence
as to the dream, and the sacrifice of a cock, have already been
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>. This kind of dream has been utilized by the
Greek Church. There is no article of ecclesiastical property of
more value than a venerable <i>icon</i>; to any church or monastery
which aspires to become a great religious centre an ancient and
reputable <i>icon</i>, competent to work miracles, is indispensable.</p>

<p>Now the most obvious way of obtaining such pictures is, it
seems, to dig them up. A few weeks underground will have
given the right tone to the crudest copy of crude Byzantine art,
and all that is required, in order to determine the spot for
excavation, is a dream on the part of some person privy to the
interment. It was on this system that the miracle-working <i>icon</i>
of Tenos came to be unearthed on the very day that the standard
of revolt from Turkey was raised, thus making the island the
home of patriotism as well as of religion. And this is no solitary
example; the number of <i>icons</i> exhumed in obedience to dreams is
immense; wherever the traveller goes in Greece, he is wearied
with the same reiterated story, and if the picture in question
happens to be of the Panagia, there is often an appendix to the
effect that the painter of it was St Luke&mdash;an attribution which
can only have been based on clerical criticism of the style. Inspection
is now difficult; the old pagan custom of covering venerable
statues with gold or silver foil by way of thank-offering<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> has, to
avoid idolatry, been transferred to <i>icons</i>; and in many cases only
the faces and the hands of the saints depicted are left visible, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
outlines of the rest of the picture being merely incised upon the
silver foil. But, with inspection thus limited, the layman does
not detect in any crudity of style a sufficient reason why the
saintly painter, if only he could have foreseen the ordinary
decoration of Greek churches, should have had his productions
put out of sight in the ground. Nevertheless the story of the
origin of the <i>icon</i> is believed as readily as the story of its finding.</p>

<p>Nor is it only in stories that the discovery of <i>icons</i> in obedience
to dreams is heard of. During my stay in Greece a village schoolmaster
embarrassed the Education Office by applying for a week’s
holiday in order to direct a party of his fellow-villagers in digging
up an <i>icon</i> of which he had dreamt, and to build a chapel for it on
the spot. It was felt that a body concerned with religious as well
as secular instruction ought not to commit the impiety of refusing
such a request, but it was feared that other schoolmasters would
be encouraged to dream.</p>

<p>Besides those visions which are concerned with the finding of
treasure or of <i>icons</i>, that class of dream also may be noticed in
which is given some divine communication as to the healing of the
sick. Many a time I have met in some sanctuary of miraculous
repute peasants from a far-off village, who have travelled from
one end of Greece to another, bringing wife or child, in the
faith that mind will be restored or sickness healed; time after
time their story is the same, that they were bidden in a dream
to go and tarry so many days in such a church, and they have
started off at once, obedient to what they feel to be a promise
of divine help, begging their way may be for many days, but
unflinchingly hopeful. And then comes the long sojourn in a
strange village, for a mere visit is not always enough; weeks and
months they wait, sleeping each night in the holy precincts and
if possible at the foot of the <i>icon</i>, hoping and believing that some
mysterious virtue of the place will heal the sufferer, or at the least
that in a fresh dream they will be told what is next to be done.
And if nothing happen&mdash;for now and then rest or change of air
or, it may be, faith<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> effects the cure desired&mdash;they return home
with hope lessened but belief unshaken, ready to obey again if
another message be vouchsafed to them from the dream-land of
heaven.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span></p>
<p>Such dreams as these are regarded as spontaneous revelations
of the divine will, granted possibly in response to prayer,
but in no way controlled or procured by any previous action
of the dreamer. But there is one curious custom, observed by
the girls of Greece, by which dreams are deliberately induced
as a means of foreknowing their matrimonial destinies. On the
eve of St Catharine’s day<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> most appropriately, for she is the
patroness of all marrying and giving in marriage, but sometimes
also on the first day of Lent<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>, the girls knead and bake cakes
(<span class="greek">ἀρμυροκούλουρα</span>) of which, as their name implies, the chief
ingredient is salt. By consuming undue quantities of this concoction,
and often by assuaging the consequent thirst with an
equally undue quantity of wine, they produce a condition of body
eminently suited to cause a troubled sleep, and, their minds being
already absorbed in speculations on marriage, it is little wonder if
their dreams reveal to them their future husbands. How far this
custom is now taken seriously, I cannot determine; in some
districts it has certainly degenerated into a somewhat disreputable
game. But the fact that the intoxication of the girls is
tolerated on this occasion among a peasantry whose men even
are seldom drunk except on certain religious occasions&mdash;on
Easter-day and after funerals&mdash;proves clearly that the custom
was once, as I think it sometimes is now, a genuinely religious
rite and an acknowledged means of divination.</p>

<p>A modification of this custom, preferred in some districts as
obviating alike the unpleasant process of eating salt-cake and the
disreputable sequel thereto, substitutes for dreaming two other
ancient methods of divination&mdash;divination by drawing lots, a
primitive system common to many peoples but employed nevertheless
even by established oracles<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> in ancient Greece, and divination
from chance words overheard by the diviner, a method which
is, I think, more exclusively Hellenic. For this form of the
custom also salt-cakes are required, but only a morsel of each is
eaten, and the remainder of the cake is divided into three portions,
to which are tied respectively red, black, and blue ribbands. Each
girl then places her three pieces under her pillow for the night,
and in the morning draws out one by chance. The red ribband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
denotes a bachelor, the black a widower, and the blue a stranger,
that is to say some one other than a fellow-villager. Then, in
order to supplement with fuller detail the indications of the lot,
the girl takes her stand in the door-way of the cottage and listens
to the casual conversation of the neighbours or the passers-by;
and the first name, trade, occupation, and suchlike which she hears
mentioned are taken to be those of her future husband.</p>

<p>Another similar custom, practised only by girls and not
necessarily taken more seriously than a game of forfeits, preserves
in its modern name <span class="greek">ὁ κλήδονας</span><a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> the old word <span class="greek">κληδών</span>, and the
purpose of the custom is to obtain that which Homer<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> actually
denoted by <span class="greek">κληδών</span>, a presage drawn from chance words. The
preliminaries of the ceremony are as follows. On the eve of the
feast of St John the Baptist<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> a boy (who for choice should be the
first-born of parents still living) is sent to fetch fresh water
from the spring or well. This water is known as <span class="greek">ἀμίλητο νερό</span>,
‘speechless water,’ because the boy who brings it is forbidden to
speak to anyone on his way. Each girl then drops into the
vessel of water some object such as a coin, a ring, or, most
frequently, an apple as her token. The vessel is then closed
up and left for the night on the roof of a house or some other
open place ‘where the stars may see it.’ The proceedings of the
next morning vary. According to one traveller<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>, each girl first
takes out her own apple&mdash;for he mentions only this token&mdash;and
then draws off some of the water into a smaller vessel. This
vessel is then supported by two other girls on the points of their
four thumbs and begins to revolve of its own accord. If it turn
towards the right, the girl may expect to marry as she wishes; if
to the left, otherwise. Also, he says, they wash their hands with
this water and then go out into the road, and take the first name
they hear spoken as that of their future husband. This latter
part of the ceremony is true to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">κλήδονας</span>
and is a genuine instance of divination from chance words. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
neither this nor the former part as described by Magnoncourt is
generally practised now. The usual procedure is either for the
boy who fetched the water or for the girls in rotation to plunge
the hand in and draw out the first object touched, improvising or
reciting at the same time some couplet favourable or adverse to
the love or matrimonial prospects of her who shall be found to
own the forthcoming object; and so in turn, until each girl has
received back her token and learnt the presage of her fate.</p>

<p>The recitation of possibly prepared distichs by those who are
taking part in the ceremony is certainly a less pure method of
divination than the earlier practice described by Magnoncourt.
The prediction is deliberately provided, and the element of chance
or of divine guidance is confined to the drawing of the token.
The older method exhibits more clearly the relation of the
modern custom to the superstitious observation of <span class="greek">κληδόνες</span> from
the time of the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> onwards. Thus when Odysseus heard
the suitors threaten to take the beggar Irus to Epirus, ‘even to
the tyrant Echetus the destroyer of all men,’ he hailed the chance
words as a divine ratification of his hope that soon the suitors
should take their own journey to another destroyer of all men,
even the tyrant of the nether world, and ‘he rejoiced in the
presage’ (<span class="greek">χαῖρεν δὲ κλεηδόνι</span>)<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>.</p>

<p>The same method of divination was frequently employed in
the classical age also, and that too not only privately<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> but even
by public oracles. It was thus that Hermes Agoraeus at Pherae
made response to his worshippers. The enquirer presented himself
towards evening before the statue of the god, burnt incense on
the hearth, filled with oil and lighted some bronze lamps that
stood there, placed a certain bronze coin of the local currency
upon the altar, whispered his question into the ear of the statue,
and then at once holding his hands over his ears made his way
out of the agora. Once outside, he removed his hands, and the
first words which greeted his ears were accepted as the god’s
response to his question<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>. A primitive statue of Hermes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
the surname <span class="greek">κλεηδόνιος</span> existed also at Pitane<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>, which place may
be the actual site of that ‘sanctuary of chance utterances’ (<span class="greek">κληδόνων
ἱερόν</span>) to which, according to Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>, the people of
Smyrna resorted for oracles. And at Thebes again Apollo Spodios
gave his replies in like manner<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly then in antiquity divination from chance words was a
well-established religious institution; and at the present day,
though the practice is rarer, its character is unchanged. The
religious nature of the two customs which I have described is shown
by their association with the festivals of St Catharine and St John
the Baptist; and though in different localities or periods a certain
amount of divination by the lot or other means has been mixed up
with divination from chance words, the latter obviously forms the
essence of both rites, supplying as it does to the one its very
name, and supplementing in the other the meagre indications of
the lot with more detailed information. A girl may learn from
the colour of the ribband attached to the piece of salt-cake which
she happens to draw whether her future husband is bachelor,
widower, or stranger; but only from the chance utterance accepted
as an answer to her own secret questionings can she learn the name
and home and occupation and appearance of her destined husband.</p>

<p>The next branch of divination, the science of reading omens of
success or failure in the objects which a traveller meets on his road,
is still largely cultivated. In old days indeed it was so elaborate
a science that a treatise, as Suidas tells us, could be written on
this one method of divination alone. Possibly the same feat might
be accomplished at the present day if a complete collection were
made of all the superstitions on the subject of ‘meeting’ (<span class="greek">ἀπάντημα</span>)
in all the villages of Greece. How instructive the results
might be, I cannot forecast; but at any rate the task is beyond me,
and I must content myself with mentioning a few of the commonest
examples. To meet a priest is always unlucky, and for
men even more so than for women, for, unless they take due
precautions as they pass him<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>, their virility is likely to be im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>paired;
and the omen is even worse if the priest happen to be
riding a donkey, for even the name of that animal is not mentioned
by some of the peasants without an apology<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>. To meet a witch
also is unfortunate, and since any old woman may be a witch, it is
wise to make the sign of the cross before passing her. A cripple
is also ominous of failure in an enterprise. On the other hand to
meet an insane person is usually accounted a good omen, for
insanity implies close communion with the powers above. To
meet a woman with child is also fortunate, for it indicates that
the journey undertaken will bear fruit; and the peasant by way of
acknowledgement never fails to bow or to bare his head, and if he
be exceptionally polite may wish the woman a good confinement.
Of animals those which most commonly forebode ill are the hare,
the rat, the stoat, the weasel, and any kind of snake. In Aetolia
superstition is so strong regarding these that the mere sight of
one of them, or indeed of the trail of a snake across the path, is
enough to deter many a peasant from his day’s work and to send
him back home to sit idly secure from morn till night; and even the
more stout-hearted will cross themselves or spit three times before
proceeding.</p>

<p>That some of these beliefs date from classical times is certain.
Aristophanes, playing upon the use of <span class="greek">ὄρνις</span>, ‘a bird,’ in the sense
of ‘omen,’ rallies the Athenians upon calling ‘a meeting a bird, a
sound a bird, a servant a bird, and an ass a bird<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>’; and there can
be little doubt that the ass belonged then as now to the category
of objects ominous to encounter on the road; and the same author<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>,
corroborated in this case by Theophrastus’ portrait of the superstitious
man<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>, speaks to the dread inspired by a weasel crossing a
man’s path. The snake too, it can hardly be doubted, was, owing
perhaps to its association with tombs, an object of awe to the superstitious
out of doors as well as within the house<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>. On the other
hand an insane person apparently was in Theophrastus’ time not
as now an omen of good but of evil, to be averted by spitting
on the bosom<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>. But though the modern interpretations of such
omens may not be identical in every respect with the old, enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
has been said to show that the science of divining from the encounters
of the road is still flourishing.</p>

<p>The observation of birds is in many cases closely allied with
the last method of divination; for naturally the peasant as he goes
on his way is as quick to notice the birds as any other object
which he encounters. But since auspices may also be taken under
other conditions, it will be well to observe the old line of demarcation,
and to treat this branch of augury, as it was treated in ancient
handbooks<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>, separately. Moreover the attitude of the modern folk
towards these two branches of divination justifies the division. The
superstitions which I have just recorded are somewhat blindly and
unintelligently held; but in the taking of auspices proper the
ordinances of ancient lore which the people follow are felt by them
to be doubly sanctioned&mdash;by reason as well as by antiquity; they
apprehend the theory on which their practice is based&mdash;the idea
that birds are better suited than any other animate thing, by
virtue both of their rapid flight and of their keen and extended
vision, to be the messengers between gods and men.</p>

<p>In practice this branch of divination is still concerned chiefly
with the large and predatory birds to which alone was originally
applied the term <span class="greek">οἰωνός</span>. ‘The largest, the strongest, the most
intelligent, and at the same time those whose solitary habits gave
them more individual character,’ says a French writer<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>, ‘were
deliberately preferred by the diviners of antiquity as the subjects
of their observation. For these and these only was reserved at
first the name <span class="greek">οἰωνός</span>, “solitary bird<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>,” or bird of presage’; and he
goes on to suggest that the Oriental belief in the magical power
of blood to revivify the souls of the dead and to stimulate prophecy
influenced the selection for a prophetic <i>rôle</i> of carnivorous birds
such as might indeed often feed on the entrails of those very victims
from which sacrificial omens were taken. But the reasons assigned
by Plutarch for the pre-eminence of birds among all other things
as the messengers of heaven apply with so special a force to the
special class of birds selected, that it seems unnecessary to search
out reasons more abstruse.</p>

<p>‘Birds,’ he says<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>, ‘by their quickness and intelligence and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
alertness in acting upon every thought, are a ready instrument for
the use of God, who can prompt their movements, their cries and
songs, their pauses or wind-like flights, thus bidding some men
check, and others pursue to the end, their course of action or ambitions.
It is on this account that Euripides calls birds in general
“heralds of gods,” while Socrates speaks of making himself “a
fellow-servant with swans.”’</p>

<p>In this special class of ominous birds the principal group, says
the same French writer<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>, was composed of the eagle (<span class="greek">ἀετός</span>), the
messenger<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> of Zeus, the ‘most perfect of birds<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>’; the vulture (<span class="greek">γύψ</span>),
which closely rivalled even the king of birds<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>; the raven (<span class="greek">κόραξ</span>),
the favourite and companion of Apollo, a bird so much observed
that there were specialists (<span class="greek">κορακομάντεις</span>) who studied no other
species; and the carrion-crow (<span class="greek">κορώνη</span>), transferred from the service
of Apollo to that of Hera<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> or Athene<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>. These, it may safely be
said, were observed at all periods. Of others, various species of
hawk (<span class="greek">ἵεραξ, ἴρηξ</span>)&mdash;in particular that known as <span class="greek">κίρκος</span>, acting
in Homeric times as the ‘swift messenger of Apollo<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>’ and thus
rivalling the raven&mdash;and with them the heron<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> (<span class="greek">ἐρωδιός</span>) enjoyed
in early times great respect, but gradually fell out of favour with
the augur. But as these disappeared from the canon of ornithological
divination, certain other birds were admitted, the wren<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
(<span class="greek">τρόχιλος</span> or <span class="greek">βασιλίσκος</span>), the owl (<span class="greek">γλαῦξ</span>)<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>, the <span class="greek">κρέξ</span> dubiously
identified with our ‘rail’ (<i>crex rallus</i>, Linn.), and the woodpecker
(<span class="greek">δρυοκολάπτης</span>).</p>

<p>The continuity of the art of taking auspices is at once obvious
when it is found that the birds which the modern peasant most
frequently observes are of the very same class which furnished the
Homeric gods with their special envoys. Eagles, vultures, hawks,
ravens, crows&mdash;these are still the chief messengers of heaven, and
only one other bird can claim equality with them, that bird which
in classical times symbolised wisdom, the owl.</p>

<p>Of the methods pursued by the professional augurs in ancient
Greece unfortunately less is known. The best treatise on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
subject is that of Michael Psellus<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>, written in the eleventh century;
but probably ancient works on the subject, such as that of
Telegonus to which Suidas<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> refers, were then extant and contributed
the bulk of his information. But even so it is the broad
principles rather than the detailed application of them which
Psellus presents, and on them we must in the main rely in comparing
the modern science with the ancient.</p>

<p>First of all the species of bird under observation had to be
ascertained; for the characters of different species were held to be
so various that birds as closely cognate as the raven and the crow
employed wholly contrary methods of communication with mankind.
‘If as we go out of our house to work,’ says Psellus<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>, ‘we
hear the cry of a raven behind or of a crow in front, it forebodes
anxieties and difficulties in our business, while if a crow fly past
and caw on the left or a raven do likewise on the other side, it
gives hope and confidence.’ The crow then was not subject even
to the rule concerning right and left which applied, so far as I
know, to all other birds, but, thanks to some innate contrariety,
reversed the normal significance of position, and therewith also of
cry and of flight<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>. Such exceptions even to the most general
rules made the accurate identification of species an indispensable
preliminary to successful augury. The same primary condition
still holds. The diviner must be able to distinguish the cawing
of a crow settled on his roof from that of a jackdaw; the former is
an omen of death, as perhaps it was in Hesiod’s day<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>, to some
member of his family, the latter heralds the coming of a letter
from a friend abroad. Again he must be able to distinguish the
brown owl (<span class="greek">κουκουβάγια</span>) from the tawny owl (<span class="greek">χαροποῦλι</span>)<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>; the
message of the former may be good or bad, as we shall see, according
to its actions, while the latter brings only presages of woe.</p>

<p>The species having been identified, there remained, according
to Psellus<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>, four possible points in the behaviour of the bird itself
(all of them liable to be modified in significance by the position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
the observer) to be noticed and interpreted; these were its cry
(anciently <span class="greek">φωνή</span> or <span class="greek">κλαγγή</span>), its flight (<span class="greek">πτῆσις</span>), its posture when
settled (<span class="greek">ἕδρα</span> or <span class="greek">καθέδρα</span>), and any movement or action performed
by it while thus settled (<span class="greek">ἐνέργεια</span>). These divisions are still
recognised in modern augury.</p>

<p>The cry is observed in the case of many birds. The scream
of an eagle is a warning of fighting or conflict to come. The
croak of a raven, especially if it be thrice repeated, while the bird
is flying over a house or a village, is a premonition of death to
one of the inmates. The laugh of the woodpecker, owing I suppose
to its mocking sound, is a sign that an intrigue against some one’s
person or pocket is in train. The repeated call of the cuckoo
within the bounds of a village forebodes an epidemic therein.</p>

<p>Flight is chiefly observed in the case of the birds of prey. The
successful swoop of an eagle upon its prey, or the rapid determined
flight of a hawk in pursuit of some other bird, is an encouragement
to the observer (provided of course that the birds are seen
on his right hand) to pursue untiringly any enterprise in which
he is engaged, and is a promise of success and profit therein. In
Scyros I once pointed out to my guide a large hawk chasing a
flock of pigeons, which he at once hailed as a good omen and
watched carefully as long as it was in sight; and when I asked
him what kind of hawk it was, he promptly replied that that
kind was known as <span class="greek">τσίκρος</span>&mdash;the goshawk, I believe. This word
is a modern form of the ancient <span class="greek">κίρκος</span><a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>, and a closely similar
incident is mentioned in the <i>Odyssey</i>, when this bird, the ‘swift
messenger of Apollo,’ is seen by Telemachus on the right, tearing
a pigeon in its talons and scattering its feathers to the ground,
and is taken to foreshow the fate that awaits Eurymachus<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>.</p>

<p>The position occupied and the posture are observed above all
in the case of owls. The ‘brown owl’ (<span class="greek">κουκουβάγια</span>), perched
upon the roof of a house and suggesting by its inert posture that
it is waiting in true oriental fashion for an event expected within
a few days, forebodes a death in the household; but if it settle
there for a few moments only, alert and vigilant, and then fly off
elsewhere, it betokens merely the advent and sojourn there of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
some acquaintance. Another species of owl, our ‘tawny owl’ I
believe, known popularly as <span class="greek">χαροποῦλι</span> or ‘Charon’s bird<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>,’ is, as
the name suggests, a messenger of evil under all circumstances,
whether it be heard hooting or be seen sitting in deathlike stillness
or flitting past like a ghost in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>The casual actions and movements of birds are less observed
now than the cry, flight, and posture; nor am I aware of any
auspices being drawn therefrom with regard to any matters of
higher importance and interest than the prospective state of the
weather. For such humdrum prognostication poultry<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> serve better
than the more dignified birds&mdash;perhaps because their movements
on the ground are more easily observed&mdash;and by pluming themselves,
by scratching a hole in which to dust themselves over, and
by roosting on one leg or with their heads turned in some particular
direction foretell rain, fine weather, or a change of wind.</p>

<p>All these auspices are further modified, as in ancient times,
by the position of the observer in reference to the bird observed.
The right hand side is the region of good omen, whether the bird
be seen or heard; and if it be a case of the bird crossing the path
of the observer, passage from left to right is to be desired, on the
principle that all is well that ends well; flight from right to left
indicates a decline of good fortune. Motion towards the right, it
may be noted, has always been the auspicious direction in Greece.
In that direction, according to Homer, the herald carried round
the lot which had been shaken from the helmet, to be claimed by
that Chieftain whose token it might prove to be<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>; in that direction
Odysseus in beggar-guise proceeded round the board, asking alms
of the suitors<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>; in that direction even the gods passed their wine<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>.
And in like manner at the present day wine is passed, cards are
played, and at weddings bride and bridegroom are led round the
altar, from left to right. Thus then in modern augury too, if the
eagle’s scream, which forebodes fighting, be heard on the right,
the hearer will come well out of it, but if on the left, he is like to
be worsted. If the woodpecker laugh on the right, the hearer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
may proceed with full confidence to cheat his neighbour, but if
the sound come from the left, he must be wary to baffle intrigues
against himself. If the hawk pursue its prey on the right or
across a man’s path from left to right, he may take the pursuer as
the type of himself and go about the work in hand with assurance
of success; but if the omen be on the other side or in the other
direction, some enemy is the hawk and he himself is the pigeon to
be plucked.</p>

<p>The interpretation of auspices is also affected by number. A
single or twice repeated cry of a bird may be of good omen, but, if
the same note be heard three times, the meaning may be reversed.
This applies in Cephallenia, as I was told, to the case already
mentioned of a raven flying over a house; one or two croaks are
a presage of security or plenty, but three are a warning of imminent
death. In this detail a pronounced change of feeling
towards the number three is responsible for what must, I think,
be a contravention of the ancient rules in the case. According to
Michael Psellus, an even number of cries from the crow were
lucky and an odd number unlucky; but the crow, as we have seen,
was perverse and abnormal; reversing therefore the rule in the case
of other birds, we find that an odd number of croaks from a raven
should be lucky. But the number three, which in old times was
lucky, is now universally unlucky; the peasant often will apologize
for having to mention the number; and Tuesday, being called <span class="greek">Τρίτη</span>,
the ‘third day’ of the week, is the unlucky day. But if in this case
the significance of a particular number has changed, the principle
of taking number into consideration is indubitably ancient.</p>

<p>Moreover there are some cases in which even the particular
application of the old principle holds good. The first, almost the
only, literary poet of modern Greece (as distinguished from the
many composers of unwritten ballads), who found beauty in the
popular beliefs and music in the vulgar tongue, makes his heroine
thus divine her own death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">Καὶ τὰ πουλάκι’ ἀποῦ ’ρθασιν συντροφιασμέν’ ὁμάδη</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">σημάδ’ εἶν’ πῶς ὀγλήγορα πανδρεύομαι ’στὸν Ἅιδη·</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And the little birds that have come consorting close together are a sign
that soon I am to be wed in Hades. I see that Erotocritus has died in a strange
land, and his soul has come to seek me, to mingle with me.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span></p>
<p>Here neither the species of the birds nor their cry nor flight is
taken into account; the whole significance of the omen turns on
the close company which they kept. And for the method of
interpreting it we can go back to Aristotle. ‘Seers observe
whether birds settle apart or settle together; the former indicates
enmity, the latter mutual peace<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>.’</p>

<p>Lastly, as regards practical augury from birds at the present
day it may be laid down as a rule that any extraordinary phenomenon,
exciting in the simple peasant’s mind more alarm than
curiosity, passes for a bad omen. The hen that so far forgets her
sex as to crow like a cock falls under suspicion and the knife at
once. To the professional diviner of old time probably such
incidents were less distressing; he could observe such striking
anomalies in as calmly judicial a spirit as the details of more
ordinary occurrences. But at the present day, though there are
magicians in plenty, there are no specialists, to my knowledge, in
the science of auspices. The modern peasant does not entice the
birds with food to a special spot, as did Teiresias<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>, in order to
listen to their talk and to gain from them deliberately the knowledge
of things that are and things that shall be. But amateur
though he be, lacking in power of minute observation and in science
of detailed interpretation, such rudiments of the art as he possesses
are an heritage from the old Hellenic masters of divination.</p>

<p>So far then as the broad principles of practical auspice-taking
are concerned, the proofs of the identity of modern with ancient
methods are sufficiently complete; and it remains only to show
that the modern practice of this art is not a mere inert survival
of customs no longer understood but is in truth informed by the
same intelligent religious spirit as in antiquity. What that spirit
was, is admirably defined in that passage of Plutarch which I have
already quoted, in which he claims that the quickness of birds and
their intelligence and their alertness to act upon every thought
qualify them, beyond all other living things, for the part of
messengers between gods and men. Celsus too in his polemics
against Christianity, made frank confession of the old faith: ‘We
believe in the prescience of all animals and particularly of birds.
Diviners are only interpreters of their predictions. If then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
birds ... impart to us by signs all that God has revealed to them, it
follows of necessity that they have a closer intimacy than we with
the divine, that they surpass us in knowledge of it, and are dearer
to God than we<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>.’ Indeed it might seem that there was hope of
birds knowing that which a god sought in vain to learn. To
Demeter enquiring for her ravished child ‘no god nor mortal man
would tell the true tale, nor came there to her any bird of omen as
messenger of truth<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>.’ In effect, the special aptitude of birds to
carry divine messages to men was never questioned in ancient
Greece; it was a very axiom of religion, without which the whole
science of auspices would have been a baseless fabrication.</p>

<p>Now it would have been no matter of surprise for us, if
practical augury had still been in vogue at the present day and
the theory had been forgotten; if the customs born of a belief in
the prophetic power of birds had, with the inveteracy of all custom,
outlived the parent principle. Rather it is surprising that among
all the perplexity and bewilderment of thought caused by the
long series of changes, religious, political, and social, through
which Greece has passed, this recognition of birds as intermediaries
between heaven and earth has abated none of its force
or its purity, neither vanquished by the direct antagonism of
Christianity, nor contaminated by the influx of Slavonic or other
foreign thought. Yet so it is; and the perusal of any collection of
modern folk-songs will show that the idea is fully as familiar now
as in the literature of old time.</p>

<p>A few examples may be cited; and in selecting them I shall
exclude from consideration those many Klephtic ballads which open
with a conversation between three ‘birds<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>’; for the word ‘bird’
(<span class="greek">πουλί</span>) seems to have become among the Klephts a colloquial
equivalent for ‘spy’ or ‘scout,’ suggested perhaps by the qualities
of intelligence, alertness, and speed required, and it is admittedly<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>
impossible in many cases to determine whether the term has its
literal or its conventional meaning. Moreover these openings of
ballads have passed into a somewhat set form; and formulae are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
no more proof of the continuance of belief than mummies of the
continuance of life.</p>

<p>But, even with the range of trustworthy evidence thus limited,
the residue of popular poetry contains ample store of passages in
which birds are recognised as the best messengers between this
world and another. And here, as we shall see, the reiteration of
the idea is not uniform in expression; the thought has not been
crystallised into a number of beautiful but inert phrases; it is still
alive, still young, still procreative of fresh poetry.</p>

<p>There is a well-known folk-song, recorded in several versions,
which tells how a young bride, trusting in the might of her nine
brothers and in her husband’s valour, boasted that she had no fear
of Charos. ‘A bird, an evil bird, went unto Charos, and told him,
and Charos shot an arrow at her and the girl grew pale; a second
and a third he shot and stretched her on her death-bed<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>.’ The
special bird in the poet’s mind was, one may surmise, ‘Charon’s
bird,’ the tawny owl, which as I have noted is always a messenger
of evil. In another poem a bird issues from the lower world and
brings doleful tidings to women who weep over their lost ones.
‘A little bird came forth from the world below; his claws were red
and his feathers black, reddened with blood and blackened with
the soil. Mothers run to see him, and sisters to learn of him, and
wives of good men to get true tidings. Mother brings sugar, and
sister scented wine, and wives of good men bear amaranth in their
hands. “Eat the sugar, bird, and drink of the scented wine, and
smell the amaranth, and confess to us the truth.” “Good women,
that which I saw, how should I tell it or confess it? I saw Charos
riding in the plains apace; he dragged the young men by the hair,
the old men by their hands, and ranged at his saddle-bow he bore
the little children<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>.”’</p>

<p>Nor is it only between earth and the nether world that birds
carry tidings to and fro; earth and heaven are equally united by
their ministry. An historical ballad, belonging to the year 1825,
when Ibrahim Pasha had just occupied the fortress of Navarino
and other places in the Morea and was about to join in investing
Mesolonghi, gives to this idea unusually imaginative treatment;
for the bird which brings from heaven encouragement and prophe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>cies
of future success (one of which was literally fulfilled in the
battle of Navarino two years later) is an incarnation of the soul
of a fallen Greek warrior. ‘“Would I were a bird” (I said), “that
I might fly and go to Mesolonghi, and see how goes the sword-play
and the musketry, how fight the unconquered falcons<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> of
Roumelie.” And a bird of golden plumage warbled answer to
me: “Hold, good George; an thou thirstest for Arab<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> blood, here
too are infidels for thee to slay as many as thou wilt. Dost see
far away yonder the Turkish ships? Charos is standing over
them, and they shall be turned to ashes.” “Good bird, how didst
thou learn this that thou tellest me?” “A bird I seem to thee
to be, but no bird am I. Yon island that I espied for thee
afar belongeth to Navarino; ’twas there I spent my last breath
a-fighting. Tsamados am I, and unto the world have I come;
from the heavens where I dwell I discern you clearly, yet yearn
to see you face to face.” “Nay, what shouldest thou see now
among us in our unhappy land? Knowest thou not what befell
and now is in the Morea?” “Good George, be not distraught,
consent not to despair; though the Morea fight not now, a time
will come again when they will fight like wild beasts and chase
their foe. Piteously shall bones lie scattered before Mesolonghi,
and there shall the lions of Suli rejoice.” And the bird flew away
and went up to the heavens<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>.’</p>

<p>Such an identification of the winged messenger with the soul
of a dead man does not represent the ordinary thought of the
people; it is a conceit peculiar to this ballad; but the very fact
that the dead warrior is made to assume the guise of a bird in
order to communicate with his living comrades shows how strong
is the popular feeling that birds are the natural intermediaries
between earth and heaven.</p>

<p>Thus then the ancient belief that birds are among the most
apt instruments of divine and human communion has survived as
little impaired by lapse of ages as the practical science of augury
founded upon it. Perhaps indeed it has even fared better; for
practical augury has, I suspect, suffered from the paucity or extinction
of professional augurs, who alone could be expected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
remember and to transmit to their successors all the complex
details of their art, whereas the old faith may even have gained
thereby; for history, I suppose, is not void of instances in which
the professional exponents of a religion have fostered its forms
and have starved its spirit, forgetting their ministry in their
desire for mastery, and making their office the sole gate of communion
with heaven. But, be that as it may, such decline as
there may have been from the complete and elaborate system of
auspices which the ancients possessed is not at any rate due to
any abatement of the ancient belief in the mediation of birds.</p>

<p>Not of course that the peasant, when he draws an omen from
the eagle’s stoop or the raven’s croak, pauses at all to reflect on
the general principle by which his act is guided; his recognition of
the principle is then as formal and unconscious as is his avowal of
Christianity when he crosses himself. But if ever in meditative
mood he seeks the reason and basis of his auspice-taking, he falls
back, as the popular poetry proves, on the doctrine that the
powers above and below have chosen birds as their messengers to
mankind.</p>

<p>Doubtless many other peoples have held or still hold kindred
beliefs; but the fact that in Modern Greece the same class of birds
is observed as in Ancient Greece and that the same broad principles
of interpretation are followed is sufficient warranty that
the underlying belief is also a genuinely Hellenic heritage.</p>

<p>The next method of divination to be considered, that namely
in which omens were obtained from sacrifice, was anciently divided
into two branches; in one the diviner concerned himself with the
dissection of the victim, and based his predictions on the appearance
of various internal parts; in the other, special portions of the
victim were consumed by fire, and omens were read in the flame
or smoke therefrom. Of the latter I have discovered no trace in
Modern Greece; but the former still survives in some districts.</p>

<p>Naturally however this mode of divination is less frequently
practised than that with which I have just dealt. The cry or the
flight of birds can be observed without let or hindrance in the
course of daily work, and, what is more important still, without
cost; while this method involves the slaying of a victim, and is
consequently confined to high days and holidays when the peasants
eat meat. But when occasion offers or even demands the per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>formance
of the rite, the presages drawn therefrom are the more
valued because they are less readily to be obtained.</p>

<p>And the value attached to them is by no means diminished
because the method pursued is less intelligent than the taking of
auspices. In the latter case, as we have seen, the common-folk
have a reasonable basis for their actions in the universal belief that
birds are by nature qualified to act as messengers between gods and
men; in the former the peasants are more blindly and mechanically
repeating the practices of their forefathers. They would be hard
put to it to say how it comes to pass that divine counsels should
be found figured in the recesses of a sheep’s anatomy. But in
their very inability to answer this question, no less than in their
acceptance of the means of communion, they resemble their
ancestors; for, with all their love of enquiry, they too practised
the art without answering conclusively or unanimously the questionings
of their own hearts concerning it. One theory advanced
was that the anatomical construction of the victim was directly
affected by the prayers and religious rites to which it was subjected.
Another held the internal symptoms to be inexorable and
immutable, and saw divine agency only in the promptings of the
sacrificer’s mind and his choice of an animal whose entrails were
suitably inscribed by nature<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>. A third view, advocated by Plato,
was that the liver was as a mirror in which divine thought was
reflected; during life this divine thought might remain hidden as
tacit intuition or be manifested in prophetic utterance; after death
the divine visions contemplated by the soul were left recorded in
imagery upon the liver, and faded only by degrees<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>. The obvious
objection to this theory was its too practical corollary, that human
entrails would be the most interesting to consult. Less barbarous
therefore in consequences, if also less exquisite in idea, was the
fourth doctrine, propounded by Philostratus, that the liver had no
power of presage unless it were completely emancipated from the
passions and surrendered wholly to divine influence&mdash;a condition
best fulfilled by animals of peaceful and apathetic temperament<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>.</p>

<p>But while these theories were built up and knocked down, the
practices which they were meant to explain continued firm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
unshaken. The fact seems to be that the custom of consulting
entrails was not native to Greece. In Homeric times the liver
was not dissected in search of omens, and such observations as
were made were directed to the brightness of the flame and the
ascent of the smoke from burnt offerings and not to any malformation
or discoloration of the victim’s inward parts. All that could
be learnt was whether the sacrifice, and therefore also the prayers
accompanying it, were accepted or rejected. The complexities of
post-Homeric divination from burnt sacrifice and the whole system
of inspecting the entrails seem to have been a foreign importation.
Whether the source was Etruscan, Carian, Cyprian, Babylonian, or
Egyptian, does not here concern us<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>; the practices were in origin
foreign to Greece, and the ancients, in referring the invention of
them to Delphus, son of Poseidon, to Prometheus, to Sisyphus, or
to Orpheus<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>, were guilty not only of sheer fabrication but of
manifest anachronism<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>. Homer convicts them.</p>

<p>It is then the foreign origin of these methods of divination
which explains the attitude of the ancient Greeks towards them.
It was a practice, not a theory&mdash;a custom, not an idea&mdash;a conglomeration
of usages, not a coherent and reasoned system&mdash;which
was introduced from abroad. The Greeks accepted it readily as
furnishing them with one more means to that communion with
their gods which to them was a spiritual necessity. The principle
of the machinery employed was unknown to them; but what
matter? Its operation was commended by the experience of
others and soon tested by their own. The unknown principle
long continued to excite interest, conjecture, speculation, among
the educated and enlightened, but their failures to reach any final
and unanimous conclusion never moved them to dispute the tested
fact. And if this was the attitude of the educated, the common-folk
of those days must surely have been in the same position as
the people of to-day&mdash;gladly accepting the usage and avowedly
ignorant of the principle. Such blind acquiescence during so
many centuries may seem indeed a disparagement of the Greeks’
intelligence; but it is equally a testimonial to their religious faith;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
it is the things which defy reasoning that are best worth believing;
and among these the Greeks have steadfastly numbered the
writing of divine counsels on the sacrificial victim’s inward parts.</p>

<p>The actual methods now pursued are also an inheritance from
the ancient world. The animal from which the Klephts a century
ago are said to have taken omens most successfully was the sheep,
and the portion of its anatomy on which the tokens of the future
were to be read was the shoulder-blade. The questions to which
an answer was most often sought were, as might be surmised from
the life of the enquirers, questions of war. ‘In this connexion,’
says a Greek writer<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> of the first half of last century, when stories
of the Klephts’ life might still be heard from their own lips, ‘the
shoulder-blade of a young lamb is ... a veritable Sibylline book; for
its condition enables men to ascertain beforehand the issue of an
important engagement, the serious losses on each side, the strength
of the enemy, the reinforcements to be expected, and indeed the
very moment when danger threatens’; and he recounts, by way of
illustration, the story of a Thessalian band of Klephts, whose
captain, in the security of his own fastness, was sitting divining
in this way; suddenly he sprang up with the exclamation, ‘The
Turks have caught us alive,’ and at the head of his troop had
only just time to break through the Turkish forces which were
already surrounding them.</p>

<p>That this method of divination was derived directly and with
little deviation from the old system of inspecting shoulder-blades
(<span class="greek">ὠμοπλατοσκοπία</span>) as known to Michael Psellus can hardly be
doubted. ‘If the question be of war,’ he says, ‘a patch of red
observed on the right side of the shoulder-blade, or a long dark
line on the left, foreshows a great war; but if both sides present
their normal white appearance, it is an omen of peace to come<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>.’</p>

<p>But the days of patriot-outlaws are over now, and the questions
submitted to the arbitrament of ovine shoulder-blades are of more
peaceful bent. It is the shepherd now, and not the warrior, who
thus resolves the uncertainties of the future. It is the vicissitudes
of weather, not of war, that interest him; the birth of lambs, not
the death of Turks. It is of plague, pestilence, and famine
threatening his flock, not of battle and murder and sudden death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
for himself, that he seeks forewarning. But the same instrument
of divination supplies the answers.</p>

<p>My own knowledge of its use is obtained entirely from
Acarnania and Aetolia; but the practice is also recorded from
Zagorion in Epirus<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>, and prevails too, I have been told, among
the shepherds of Elis. The opportunity for it is, as I have said,
offered only by certain feast-days, when the peasants indulge in
meat. On other occasions, when the shepherds kill only in order
to sell in the towns, divination cannot be undertaken; for it is
only after cooking that the meat can be properly removed from
the bone so as to leave it clean and legible. There is therefore no
doubt an economical reason for confining this practice to certain
religious festivals; but this consideration must not be allowed to
obscure the genuinely religious character of the rite itself. In
Zagorion, at the festivals in honour of the patron-saint of each
village or monastery, sheep are brought and slain in the enclosure
of the particular sanctuary, and are called <span class="greek">κουρμπάνι̯α</span><a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>, a plural
evidently of the Hebrew word ‘corban,’ a thing devoted to the
service of God; thus both name and ceremony proclaim this
custom a genuine survival of sacrifice; and it is apparently from
the shoulder-blades of these victims that omens are drawn<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>. A
similar case of divination by sacrifice came to my knowledge in
Boeotia, though whether the shoulder-blade or some other part
of the victim furnished the predictions, I could not ascertain.
While looking round a small museum at Skimitári I had happened
to stop before a relief representing a man leading some
animal to sacrifice, and heard the custodian, a peasant of the
place, remark to another peasant, evidently a stranger to the
district, who had followed me in, ‘That is just like what we do’;
and he then explained that at a church of St George, somewhere
in the neighbourhood, there was an annual festival at which a
similar scene took place. The villagers of the country-side congregate
early on the morning of St George’s day round the church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
each man bringing a kid or a lamb; service in the church having
been duly performed, the priest comes out and blesses each of the
animals in turn, after which they are killed and roasted and a feast
is held accompanied by some kind of divination from the victims.
Such in brief was the custodian’s account; but, when I intervened
in the conversation with a question about the method of divining,
he would say nothing more. The Boeotians are still boorish.
But what I had already overheard exhibits clearly enough the
religious character of the rite; and I do not doubt that in Aetolia
and Acarnania also the peasants handle the sheep’s shoulder-blade
in an equally religious mood. Their very indulgence in
meat is due to the religious occasion; much more therefore the
divination which reveals to them the mind of those powers whom
they worship.</p>

<p>In the art of interpreting the particular marks upon the
shoulder-blade I cannot claim to be an adept. The few facts
which I managed to discover were that in general spots and blurs
upon the bone are prognostications adverse to the hopes of the
enquirer, and that a clean white surface always gives full security:
that different portions of the bone are scrutinised for answers to
different classes of questions; thus the prospects of the lambing
season are indicated on the projecting ridge of the bone, and the
weather-forecast on the flat surfaces on either side of it, marks on
the right side (the bone being held horizontally with what is
naturally its upper end towards the diviner) being favourable
signs, and those on the left ill-omened: and finally that a pestilence
is foreshown by a depression in the surface of the bone.
The science, I was told, is extremely complex and elaborate; but
I never had the fortune to meet any peasant who was considered
an expert in it; the best exponents of it are to be found among
the mountain shepherds, and since these are constantly shifting
their grazing grounds it is no easy matter to fall in with one both
able and willing to unfold the full mysteries of the art. How to
distinguish in interpretation markings of different sizes, shapes,
and colours I never discovered<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>.</p>

<p>But the little which I learnt agrees in the main with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
ancient method as described by Michael Psellus<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>. ‘Those,’ he says,
‘who wish to avail themselves of this means of divination, pick out
a sheep or lamb from the flock, and, after settling in their mind or
saying aloud the question which they wish to ask, slay the victim
and remove the shoulder-blade from the carcase. This&mdash;the
organ of divination as they think&mdash;they bake thoroughly upon
hot embers, and having stripped it of the flesh find on it the
tokens of that issue about which they are enquiring. The answers
to different kinds of questions are learnt from different parts<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>.
Questions of life or death are decided by the projection of the
ridge<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>; if this is clean and white on both sides, a promise of life
is thereby given; but if it is blurred, it is a token of death.
Weather-forecasts again are made from inspection of the middle
part of the shoulder-blade; if the two membrane-like surfaces
which form the middle of the shoulder-blade on either side of the
ridge<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> are white and clean, they indicate calm weather to come;
while, if they are thickly spotted, the reverse is to be expected.’
Here, it will have been noticed, no mention is made of any discrimination
between the markings on the right and on the left sides
of the bone; but this, I suspect, is an omission on the part of
Psellus, for so simple a principle of ancient divination is hardly
likely to have been excluded from consideration in this case. In
other respects the information which I obtained tallies closely
with his account; the clean and white appearance of the bone
was then, as it is now, a reassuring omen; then, as now, the
prospects of the weather were to be learnt from the flat surface
on either side of the ridge; then, as now, the question of life or
death, which from the shepherd’s point of view becomes most
acute at each lambing season, was settled by reference to the
ridge of the bone. To judge then from the few principles of the
art known to me, divination from the shoulder-blade, besides
being still recognised as a religious rite, is conducted on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
same lines by Aetolian and Acarnanian peasants as it was by
those ancient augurs to whose hand-books probably Psellus was
indebted for his knowledge.</p>

<p>Another animal utilised in the same district for purposes of
divination is the pig; but in this case the prophetic organ is not
the shoulder-blade but the spleen. This is removed from the
fresh carcase before the rest of the flesh is cut up or cooked in
any way, and omens are taken from the roughness or discoloration
of its surface. The questions which may be decided by this
means are very various&mdash;the prospects of weather, of crops,
and of vineyards, the success of journeys and other enterprises,
the advisability of a contemplated marriage, and so forth. Of the
exact details of the art I know even less than in the last case;
the facts which I learned were these, that a smooth surface is a
good omen, just as it was in the case of other internal organs in
the time of Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>, while certain roughnesses portend obstacles
and difficulties in a journey or enterprise, and further that
certain abnormal blotches of colour give warning of blight and
mildew on crops and vines. Proficiency in the science, I was told,
is commonest among the inhabitants of the low-lying cultivated
or wooded districts of Acarnania where large herds of half-wild
swine are kept; and hence it is natural that the predictions
sought in this way are chiefly concerned with agricultural and
social interests, whereas the omens obtained from the sheep’s
shoulder-blade by shepherds living solitary lives in the mountains
deal with few issues other than the prospects of the flock. But
this difference between the two methods of divination is circumstantial
rather than essential; either method can, I believe,
in the hands of experts be used for answering almost any questions.</p>

<p>Divination from the pig’s spleen is, I think, undoubtedly ancient.
It appears to be a solitary survival of the <span class="greek">σπλαγχνοσκοπία</span>, or
‘inspection of entrails,’ which in ancient Greece would seem to
have been the commonest method of divining from the sacrificial
victim. Among the animals embarrassed with prophetic entrails
the pig indeed was not ordinarily reckoned; but Pausanias
mentions that the people of Cyprus discovered its value<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
it seems actually to have furnished responses to the highly reputable
oracle of Paphos<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>. How it has come to pass that modern
Acarnania should preserve a custom peculiar to ancient Cyprus, is
a problem that I cannot solve; but it can hardly be questioned that
here again we have an old religious rite still maintained as a proven
means of communion with those powers in whose knowledge lies
the future.</p>

<p>Divination from sacrifice also forms part of the preliminaries
of a wedding in many districts. On the day before the actual
ceremony<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> the first animal for the feast is killed by the bridegroom
with his own hand. The proper victim is a young ram,
though in case of poverty a more humble substitute is permitted.
This, after being in some districts blessed by the priest who
receives in return a portion of the victim, is made to stand facing
eastward, and the bridegroom endeavours to slaughter it with a
single blow of an axe. Omens for the marriage are taken from
the manner and the direction in which the blood spirts out; and
a further investigation is sometimes made as to whether the
tongue is bitten or the mouth foaming, each sign finding its
own interpretation in the lore of the village cronies<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>. The substitute
allowed for the ram is a cock. Where the peasants avail
themselves of this economy, the killing is usually deferred until
after the wedding service, and is performed on the doorstep of
the bridegroom’s house before the bride is led in. The bird is
held down on the threshold by the best man, and the bridegroom,
having been provided with a sharp axe, tries to sever the cock’s
neck at one blow. Here too the man’s dexterity counts for something;
for the peace or the agony in which the victim is despatched
belongs to that class of omens which in antiquity also were drawn
from the demeanour of the animal before and during the act of
sacrifice, and were taken not indeed to furnish a detailed answer
to any question preferred but to indicate the acceptance or the
rejection of the offering and the accompanying petitions. It
is however the effusion of blood and the muscular convulsions
of the decapitated bird which are most keenly observed; for from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
these signs, I was told, the old women of the village profess
to determine such points of interest as the chastity of the
bride, the supremacy of the husband or the wife in the future
<i>ménage</i>, and the number and sex of children to be born. All this
information can in most places where the rite prevails be obtained
without any dissection of the victim such as would have been
customary in antiquity; but in Aetolia and Acarnania the peasants
continue faithful to what are probably ancient methods even in
this detail; there the breast-bone of the fowl is treated both
at weddings and on other religious occasions as a poor man’s
legitimate substitute for the ovine shoulder-blade, which it
sufficiently resembles in the possession of a ridge with flat surfaces
on either side suitable for divine inscriptions.</p>

<p>But it is not upon coincidences of practical detail, instructive
as they are in proving the unity of modern with ancient Greece,
that I wish most to insist. If it is clear that the victims often
blest by the priests at weddings and on other religious occasions
are really felt by the people to be sacrifices, then the practice of
divining from them, whatever the exact method pursued, is once
more distinct evidence of the belief that the powers above are able
and willing to hold close communion with men.</p>

<p>Among the minor methods of divination we may notice first
what Suidas calls <span class="greek">οἰκοσκοπικόν</span> or ‘domestic divination’; under
this head he includes such incidents as the appearance of a weasel
on the roof, or of a snake, the spilling of oil, honey, wine, water,
or ashes, and the crackling of logs on the fire. The subject was
expounded apparently in a serious treatise by one Xenocrates;
but it is difficult to suppose that there was any scientific system
governing so heterogeneous a conglomeration of incidents; the
treatise was probably no more than a compilation of possible
occurrences with disconnected regulations for interpreting each
of them.</p>

<p>Many events of a like trivial nature are observed at the
present day, and the interpretations set upon some of them are
demonstrably ancient. A weasel seen about the house, just as
on the road, is significant of evil<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>, more especially if there is in
the household a girl about to be married; for the weasel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
(<span class="greek">νυφίτσα</span>) was once, it is said, a maiden destined to become, as
the name implies, a ‘little bride,’ but in some way she was robbed
of her happiness and transformed into an animal; its appearance
therefore augurs ill for an intended wedding. A snake on the
contrary is of good omen when seen in the house; for it is the
guardian-<i>genius</i> watching over its own. The orientation of a cat
when engaged in washing its face indicates the point of the
compass from which wind may be expected. A mouse nibbling
a hole in a bag of flour is in Zagorion<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> as distressing a portent as
it was to the superstitious man of Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>. A dog howling
at night in or near the house portends a death in the neighbourhood,
as it did in the time of Theocritus: ‘Hark,’ cries Simaetha,
‘the dogs are barking through the town. Hecate is at the cross-ways.
Haste, clash the brazen cymbals<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>’; only instead of the
cymbals it is customary to use an ejaculation addressed to the
dog, ‘may you burst’ (<span class="greek">νὰ σκάσῃς</span>), or ‘may you eat your own
head’ (<span class="greek">νὰ φᾶς τὸ κεφάλι σου</span>).</p>

<p>Again, to take another class of the domestic incidents mentioned
by Suidas, the spilling of oil is universally an evil omen,
and the spilling of wine a good omen; the former foreshadows
poverty, the latter plenty. The upsetting of water is also a
presage of good success, especially on a journey; but in this
connexion, as a later chapter will show, it often passes out of
the sphere of divination, which should rest on purely fortuitous
occurrences, into that of sympathetic magic.</p>

<p>The crackling of logs on the fire, which Suidas mentions,
remains to-day also an incident to be duly noted. Generally it
appears to mean that good news is coming or that a friend is
arriving, but, if sparks and ashes are thrown out into the room,
troubles and anxieties must be expected. The spluttering of a
lamp or candle also usually foretells misfortune<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>. Omens as to
marriage also may be obtained on the domestic hearth. Two
leaves of basil are put together upon a live coal; if they lie as
they are placed and burn away quietly, the marriage will be harmonious;
if there is a certain amount of crackling, the married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
life of the two persons represented by the leaves will be disturbed
by quarrels; if the leaves crackle fiercely and leap apart, there
is an incompatibility of temper which renders the projected
alliance undesirable.</p>

<p>These are but a few instances of domestic divination, and a
much longer list might easily be compiled. But while I know
that many of the peasants do indeed observe such occurrences
seriously enough to act upon the supernatural warnings thereby
conveyed, yet the religious character of these methods of divination
is less demonstrable than that of divination from birds or
from sacrifice; and I may content myself with indicating, by a
few illustrations only, the continuity of Greek superstition in
both this and those other minor branches of divination to which
I now pass.</p>

<p>Palmistry, according to Suidas, was an ancient art, and a
hand-book of it was composed by one Helenos. The signs of the
future were read in the lines of the palm and of the fingers as
in modern palmistry. This science is still kept up by some of the
old women in Greece, but real proficiency therein is as in other
countries chiefly attained by the gypsies (<span class="greek">ἀτσίγγανοι</span>), who follow
a nomadic life in the mountains and have very little intercourse
with the native population.</p>

<p>Divination from involuntary movements of various parts of the
body&mdash;<span class="greek">παλμικόν</span>, as Suidas calls it, on which one Poseidonios
was a leading authority&mdash;is still very generally practised, and
evidently has deviated hardly at all from ancient lines. The
twitching of a man’s eye or eyebrow is a sign that he will soon
see some acquaintance&mdash;an enemy, if it be the left eye that
throbs, a friend, if it be the right; and this clearly was the principle
which the goat-herd of Theocritus followed when he exclaimed,
‘My eye throbs, my right eye; oh! shall I see Amaryllis
herself?’<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Similarly the buzzing or singing of a man’s ears is an
indication that he is being spoken of by others, just as it was
in the time of Lucian<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>; and, according to the usual principle, the
right ear is affected in this manner by praise and kindly speech,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
the left by backbiting and slander. Again, if the palm of the
right hand itch, it shows that a man will receive money; and
reversely, if the left palm itch, he will have to pay money away<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>.
So too, if the sole of the right or of the left foot itch, it is a premonition
of a journey successful or unsuccessful. Omens of this
kind fall with uncomfortable frequency to the lot of those who
have to find a night’s lodging in Greek inns or cottages.</p>

<p>To the same category belong hiccoughing and sneezing. The
hiccough (<span class="greek">λόξυγγας</span>), as also in Macedonia choking over food or
drink<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>, is a sign that some backbiter is at work, and the method of
curing it is to guess his name. Sneezing is a favourable omen,
but the particular interpretation of it depends on alternative sets
of circumstances. If anyone who is speaking is interrupted by a
sneeze, whether his own or that of another person present, whatever
he is saying is held to be proved true by the occurrence.
<span class="greek">’Γειά σου</span>, cry the listeners, <span class="greek">καὶ ἀλήθεια λές</span> (or <span class="greek">λέει</span>), ‘Health to
you, and you speak (<i>or</i> he speaks) truth.’ If however no one present
is in the act of speaking when the sneeze is heard, the first
phrase only is used, ‘Health to you,’ or by way of facetious
variant, <span class="greek">νὰ ψοφήσῃ ἡ πεθερά σου</span>, ‘May your mother-in-law die
like a dog<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>.’ In either case the prayer for good health can benefit
only the sneezer; but in the former, that member of the company
who is speaking at the time may obtain corroboration of the statement
which he is making from the omen produced by another.
This part of the belief is very strongly held; and anyone who is
in the unfortunate position of having his word doubted or of being
compelled to prevaricate will be better advised to conjure up a
sneeze than to expostulate or to swear.</p>

<p>Both these interpretations of sneezing date from ancient times.
The old equivalent of ‘Health to you’ was <span class="greek">Ζεῦ σῶσον</span>, ‘Preserve
him, Zeus’; but such expressions are common to many nations
and not distinctively Hellenic. The other interpretation of
sneezing, as a confirmation of words which are being uttered, is
of more special interest, and has been handed down from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
Homeric age. ‘Let but Odysseus come,’ says Penelope, ‘and
reach his native land, and soon will he and his son requite the
violent deeds of these men.’ ‘Thus she spake,’ continues the passage,
‘and Telemachos sneezed aloud; and round about the house rang
fearfully; and Penelope laughed, and quickly then she spake
winged words to Eumaeus: “Go now, call the stranger here before
me. Dost thou not see how my son did sneeze in sanction of
all my words<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>? For this should utter death come upon the
suitors one and all, nor should one of them escape death and
destruction<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>.”’</p>

<p>Among other instruments of divination occasionally used are
eggs, molten lead, and sieves. Eggs are chiefly used to decide the
prospects of a marriage. ‘Speechless water’<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> is fetched by a boy,
and the old woman who presides over such operations pours into
it the white of an egg. If this keeps together in a close mass, the
marriage will turn out well; but if it assumes a broken or confused
shape, troubles loom ahead. In antiquity the science was probably
more extended; for a work on egg-divining (<span class="greek">ὠοσκοπικά</span>)
was attributed to Orpheus. A similar rite may be performed
with molten lead instead of white of egg, and it suffices to pour it
upon any flat surface<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>. Divination with a sieve&mdash;the ancient
<span class="greek">κοσκινομαντεία</span>&mdash;also continues, I have been told, but I know no
details of the practice.</p>

<p>Thus then the chief methods of learning the gods’ will as
practised in antiquity have been reviewed, and are found to be
perpetuated in substantially the same form down to the present
day; and not only is the form the same but in many of them the
same religious spirit is manifest. The principal difference lies in
the paucity of professional diviners now; experts assuredly in
some branches there still are, but augury alone would now,
I think, be a precarious source of livelihood. Advice from the
village priest would in so many cases be cheaper and no less valued
than that of the soothsayer.</p>

<p>And as with persons so with places. The pagan temples in
which oracles were given have been largely superseded by Christian
churches, and possibly the peasants are more inclined to pay for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
masses which will secure the fulfilment of their wishes than for
oracular responses which may run counter to them. Still even so
oracles have not yet entirely ceased; and in discussing those which
survive we shall find once more a coincidence both in form and
spirit between ancient and modern Greek religion.</p>

<p>An oracle, it must be remembered, is simply a place set
apart for the practice of divination; the method of obtaining
responses has always varied in different places, and the mediation
of a professional diviner, though usual, cannot be regarded as
essential<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>. Those caves therefore where women make offerings
of honey-cakes to the Fates<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> and pray for the fulfilment of their
conjugal hopes are really oracles, provided that there is some
means of learning there whether the prayer is accepted or rejected.
And this is often the case; most commonly the answer is inferred&mdash;on
what principle of interpretation, I do not know&mdash;from the
dripping of water or the detachment and fall from the roof of a
particle of stone; and in Aetolia I was told of a cave in the
neighbourhood of Agrinion in which the nature of the response
is determined by the behaviour of the bats which frequent it.
If they remain hanging quiescent from the roof and walls, the
suppliant’s hopes will be realised; but if they be disturbed by
his or, more often, her intrusion and flutter round confusedly, the
Fates are inexorably adverse.</p>

<p>But besides these modest and unpretentious oracles there
still survives in the island of Amorgos an oracle of a higher order
ensconced in a church and served by a priest. The saint under
whose patronage this pagan institution has continued to flourish is
St George, here surnamed Balsamites<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. To the right on entering
the church is seen a large squared block of marble hollowed out
so as to have the form of an urn inside, and highly polished.
It stands apparently on the natural rock, and is roofed over
with a dome-shaped lid capable of being locked. At the present
day the mouth of the urn is also covered by a marble slab with
a hole pierced through it and fitted with a plug; but this was not
observed by travellers of the seventeenth century and is probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
a recent addition. There is also a discrepancy in the various
accounts of the working of the oracle, the older authorities stating
that the answers were given by the rise and fall of the water in
the vessel, while the modern custom is to interpret the signs
given by particles of dust, insects, hairs, bits of dry leaf, and suchlike
floating in a cupful of water drawn from the urn<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>.</p>

<p>The description given by a Jesuit priest of Santorini, Robert
Sauger by name, of what he himself witnessed in Amorgos towards
the end of the seventeenth century may be taken as trustworthy,
inasmuch as he elsewhere shows himself an accurate
observer and certainly was not tempted in the present case to
exaggerate the wonders of the rival Church.</p>

<p>‘The cavity,’ he says, ‘fills itself with water and empties itself
of its own accord, and it is impossible to imagine what gives the
water this motion and where it has a passage; for, besides being
very thick, the marble is so highly polished inside and its continuity
of surface is so unbroken that it is impossible to detect the tiniest
hole or the least unevenness, saving always the opening at the top
which is always kept locked. Additionally astonishing is the fact
that within the space of one hour the urn fills and empties itself
visibly several times; at one moment you see it so full that the
water overflows, and a moment afterwards it becomes so dry that
it appears to have had no water in it at all.</p>

<p>‘Superstition is rife everywhere. Any Greeks who have a
voyage to make do not fail to come and consult the Urn. If the
water is high in it, they set off gaily, promising themselves a good
passage. But if the Urn is without water, or the water is low in
it, they draw therefrom a bad omen for the success of their
journey, and do not go, or, if business makes it imperative, go
unwillingly.</p>

<p>‘This alleged miracle, which is so famed throughout all Greece,
is a source of much gain to the priest who has charge of the
Church of St George; for the concourse of Greeks there is incessant;
people come thither from great distances, some in all
seriousness to advise themselves of the future, others to see the
thing with their own eyes, and a certain number to amuse them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>selves
and to have a laugh, as I have had several times, at the
credulity of these folk<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>.’</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the original method of oracular
response&mdash;and I suspect that, while the presence or the absence
of water furnished a plain ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ to the enquirer, a more
detailed reply always depended upon the observation and interpretation
of any foreign particles floating in the urn&mdash;the faith of
the people in its virtue is still intense. It can indeed no longer
claim a reputation throughout all Greece; but the inhabitants of
Amorgos and the maritime population of neighbouring islands still
consult it regularly and seriously concerning voyages, business
matters, marriage, and other cares and interests; nor are questioners
from farther afield altogether unknown.</p>

<p>This oracular property of water was well known in antiquity.
In this branch of divination, says Bouché Leclercq, use was made
‘of springs and streams which were felt to be endowed with a
kind of supernatural discernment. Certain waters were accorded
the property of confirming oaths and exposing perjury. The water
of the Styx, by which the Olympian gods swore, is the prototype
of these means of test, among which may be mentioned the spring
of Zeus Orkios, near Tyane, and the water-oracle of the Sicilian
Palici<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>.’ So too water-deities such as Nereus and Proteus were
believed to exercise special prophetic powers; and Ino possessed
in the neighbourhood of Epidaurus Limera a pool into which
barley-cakes were thrown by those who would consult her; if these
offerings sank, she was held to have accepted them and to favour
the enquirer; if they floated, his hopes would be disappointed<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>.</p>

<p>The present oracle of Amorgos is of a higher order than this;
its method is more complex, and its responses are more detailed.
It should surely have ranked high even among the oracles of old,
of which, both in the reverence which it inspires and in the
medium which it employs, it is a true descendant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having thus examined the means by which the gods deign to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
communicate with men, and having seen that both in form and in
spirit the ancient means of communion have been preserved almost
unchanged, we have now to consider the means by which men
approach the gods and communicate to them their hopes and
petitions.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious method, one common to all religions,
is of course prayer; but the use of this channel just because it is so
universal cannot be claimed as a proof of religious unity between
ancient and modern Greece. It is rather in what we should deem
the accompaniments of prayer that evidence of such unity must be
sought. The ancient Greeks were not in general content with
prayer only. It was not customary to approach the gods empty-handed.
The poor man indeed, according to Lucian<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>, appeased the
god merely by kissing his right hand; but the farmer brought an
ox from the plough, the shepherd a lamb, the goat-herd a goat, and
others incense or a cake. ‘Thus it looks,’ he says, ‘as if the gods
do nothing at all <i>gratis</i>, but offer their commodities for sale to
men; one may buy of them health, for instance, at the cost of a
calf, wealth for four oxen, a kingdom for a hecatomb, a safe return
passage from Ilium to Pylos for nine bulls, and the crossing from
Aulis to Ilium for a princess&mdash;a high price certainly, but then
Hecuba was bidding Athene twelve cows and a dress to keep Ilium
safe. One must suppose however that they have plenty of things
to dispose of at the price of a cock, a garland, or even a stick of
incense<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>.’ That this is a fair account of the externals of Greek
ritual can hardly be questioned; for Plato too, in more serious
mood, says that ‘the mutual communion between gods and men’
is established by ‘sacrifices of all kinds and the various departments
of divination<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>.’ The ‘various departments of divination’
are clearly the means by which the gods communicate with men;
and ‘sacrifices of all kinds’ therefore represented to Plato’s mind
the means by which men communicate with their gods. Prayer,
he seems to have felt, was a necessary incident in sacrifice, rather
than sacrifice an unnecessary adjunct to prayer.</p>

<p>Now the word <span class="greek">θυσία</span>, which we commonly translate ‘sacrifice,’
was a term of very wide meaning in ancient Greek. In Homer
the word <span class="greek">θύειν</span> was used of making any offering to the gods, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
never denoted, though naturally it sometimes connoted, the
slaughtering of animals&mdash;an act properly expressed by the verb
<span class="greek">σφάζειν</span>. And in later times the substantive <span class="greek">θυσία</span> was still
applied to almost any religious festival, at which undoubtedly
some offerings, but not necessarily animal sacrifices, were always
made. When therefore Plato speaks of <span class="greek">θυσίαι πᾶσαι</span>, ‘all sacrifices,’
he is clearly expressing his recognition of the fact that sacrifices
(<span class="greek">θυσίαι</span>) are manifold in kind&mdash;and if in kind, therefore also in
intention; for different rituals are the expressions of different
religious motives. Communion with the gods was in general
terms the object of all offerings made to them by men; but the
particular aspect of such communion varied.</p>

<p>Offerings, we may suppose, were rarely if ever made purely
for the benefit of the gods without any self-seeking on the part of
the worshipper. Even when a sacrifice to some god was merely a
pretext for social entertainments&mdash;and how frequently this was
the case is shown by the fact that <span class="greek">φιλοθύτης</span>, ‘fond of sacrificing,’
came to mean simply ‘hospitable’&mdash;it is reasonable to suppose
that the presentation to the god of the less edible portions of the
victim was accompanied at least by an <span class="greek">ἵλαθι</span>, ‘be propitious,’ by
way of grace before the meal; and at more strictly religious
functions, at which the guests, if there were any, were secondary
to the god, the dedication of the offering undoubtedly included a
declaration of the offerer’s motive.</p>

<p>As regards the character of that motive in most cases, Lucian
is right; it was frankly and baldly commercial. Homer does not
blink the fact; for Phoenix even commends to the notice of
Achilles the open mind displayed by the gods towards an open-handed
suppliant. ‘Verily even the gods may be turned, they
whose excellence and honour and strength are greater than thine;
yet even them do men, when they pray, turn from their purpose
with offerings of incense and pleasant vows, with fat and the
savour of sacrifice, whensoever a man hath transgressed and done
amiss<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>.’ And so Greek feeling has ever remained. Offerings are
the ordinary means of gaining access to the gods, of buying their
goodwill and buying off their anger. The ordinary medium of
exchange in such commerce was, when Greece was avowedly pagan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
food, and is, now that Greece is nominally Christian, candles: for
religion, ever conservative, keeps up the otherwise obsolete system
of barter between men and gods, even though the priests of those
gods are enlightened enough to accept of a secular modern
currency. But the particular commodities in which the barter is
made are of little consequence as compared with the spirit which
has always animated such dealings. The substitution of candles
for meat is practically the only modification which Christianity
has effected in this department of religion.</p>

<p>Even this change in detail does not affect the whole range of
such operations; candles are not by any means the only offerings
of which the Church takes cognisance. In dealing with the question
of divination, we have seen cases in which on some religious
occasion, saint’s-day or wedding, the priest blesses a genuinely
sacrificial victim<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>. We have seen too that at the laying of foundation
stones, a religious ceremony conducted by a priest of the
Church, some animal is immolated to appease the <i>genius</i> of the
site<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>. We have seen again how the Church permits or encourages
the dedication of those silver-foil models of various objects&mdash;ships
and houses, corn-fields and vineyards, eyes and limbs&mdash;which serve
at once to propitiate the saint to whom they are offered and, on
the principle of sympathetic magic, to place the object, thus
represented as it were by proxy, under the saint’s special care;
and how also the same kind of models are frequently dedicated as
thank-offerings<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>; so that indeed, in default of an inscription announcing
the motive of the offerer, no one can decide how any
given offerings of this kind should be classified<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>.</p>

<p>Then too in those religious rites which have survived without
ecclesiastical sanction the use and the purpose of food-offerings
remain unchanged. The favour of the Fates is bought by offerings
of cakes in order that they may bestow upon the women
who thus propitiate them the blessing of children<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>. Nereids who
have ‘seized’ children are known to withdraw their oft-times
baneful influence when the mother takes a present of food to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
scene of the calamity and cries to them with an Homeric simplicity,
‘Eat ye the little cakes, good queens, and heal my child<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>.’
Even the malice of Callicantzari may sometimes be averted by a
present of pork<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus with or without the ratification of the Church the old
offerings still continue to be made in the self-same form; and even
where other substitutes have been devised, the spirit which
animates the dedication of them is unchanged&mdash;a spirit essentially
commercial; it matters little whether the suppliant is trying to
buy blessings or to get the punishment which he has deserved
commuted for a fine, or again whether he is speculating in future
favours or settling in accordance with a vow for favours received;
in each case there is the <i>quid pro quo</i>, the bargaining that the
Greek has never been able to forego, not even in his religion.</p>

<p>But while the spirit thus manifested is not wholly admirable
and perhaps deserved the ridicule of Lucian, it is highly instructive.
The sacrifices or offerings are the means by which the
worshipper gets into touch with the worshipped, the vehicle for
his thanks or petitions; the possibility of bargaining implies intercourse;
commerce is a form, even though it be the lowest form,
of communion.</p>

<p>But that there were other kinds of sacrifice which represented
higher aspects of the communion between men and gods in ancient
Greece is certain. The commonly accepted classification of ancient
sacrifices recognises three main groups&mdash;the sacramental, the
honorific, and the piacular. Of the sacramental class, in which&mdash;by
a development, it appears, of totemism&mdash;some sacred animal,
representing the anthropomorphic god who has superseded it in
men’s worship, is consumed by the worshippers in order that by
eating the flesh and drinking the blood they may partake of the
god’s own life and self, no trace, so far as I know, can now be found
in the popular religion. The honorific class comprises the majority
of those offerings which might with less euphemism be called
commercial; those however which are prompted by the desire to
expiate sin, or rather to buy off the punishment which sin has
merited, would, I suppose, fall under the head of piacular. But
the line drawn between the honorific and the piacular seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
me far from clear, for reasons which will be discussed in the
remainder of this chapter.</p>

<p>The view of sacrifice which I am about to propound, and which
would modify chiefly our conception of so-called piacular sacrifice
in antiquity, was suggested to me by a story which I had from
the lips of an aged peasant of the village of Goniá (the ‘Corner’)
in the island of Santorini<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>. In talking to me of the wonders of
his native island he mentioned among other things a large hall
with columns round it which had long since been buried&mdash;presumably
by volcanic eruption. This hall was of magnificent
proportions, ‘as fine,’ to use the old man’s own description, ‘as the
<i>piazza</i> of Syra or even of Athens.’ It was situated between
Kamári, an old rock-cut shelter in the shape of an <i>exedra</i> at the
foot of the northern descent from the one mountain of the island
(<span class="greek">μέσο βουνί</span>), and a chapel of St George in the strip of plain that
forms the island’s east coast. So far my informant’s veracity
is beyond dispute; for in an account of the island written by a
resident Jesuit in the middle of the seventeenth century I afterwards
discovered the following corroboration<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a>. ‘At the foot of
this mountain<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> are seen the ruins of a fine ancient town; the huge
massive stones of which the walls were built are a marvel to
behold; it must have taken some stout arms and portentous hands
to handle them.... Among these ruins have been found some fine
marble columns perfectly complete, and some rich tombs; and
among others there are four which would bear comparison in
point of beauty with those of our kings, if they were not damaged;
several marble statues in Roman style lie overturned upon the
ground. On the pedestal of the statue of Trajan there is still to
be read at the present day a very fine Greek panegyric of that
powerful Emperor, as also on that of the statue of Marcus
Antoninus.’ Thus much as guarantee of the old man’s <i>bona fides</i>,
which even excavation on the spot, however desirable from an
archaeological standpoint, could not more clearly establish than
the French writer’s corroborative testimony; now for the story
associated by the aged narrator with this wonderful buried hall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
At the time of the revolution, he said, a number of the Greek
ships assembled off Kamári (where a fair anchorage exists), and
he with some fellow-islanders all since dead was going to fight in
the cause of Greek freedom. Naturally enough there was great
excitement and trepidation in this remote and quiet island at the
thought of adventure and war. ‘So we thought things over,’ he
continued, ‘and decided to send a man to St Nicolas to ask him
that our ships might prosper in the war<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>.’ They accordingly seized
a man and took him to this large hall. There they cut off his
head and his hands, and carried him down the steps into the hall,
whereupon God appeared with a bright torch in his hand, and the
bearers of the body dropped it, and all present fled in terror.</p>

<p>There are few grounds on which to argue for or against the
credibility of this story. Historically Thera along with some other
islands is recorded to have maintained the position of a neutral
by paying contributions to both sides; but that does not in
any way militate against the supposition that a few young men
from the island were patriotic enough to volunteer for service
in some of the Greek ships which may have touched&mdash;perhaps to
secure that contribution&mdash;at Santorini. The story itself was
narrated to me, I am persuaded, in all good faith, and the old
man really believed himself to have taken part in the events
described. His age would certainly have permitted him to fight
as a young man in the revolution; he himself estimated (in the
year 1899) that he had lived more than a century, and other old
men of the village who were well past their threescore years and
ten reckoned him senior to themselves by a full generation;
moreover his own reminiscences of the war argued a personal
share in the fighting. But whether the savage episode which he
described was really a prelude to that most savage war, or some
traditional event of the island’s history post-dated and inserted in
the most glorious epoch of modern Greek history, is a question
which cannot be finally determined. Chronology to a peasant
who does not know the year of his own birth is naturally a matter
of some indifference, and excitability of imagination coupled with
the habit, or rather the instinct, of self-glorification in the Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
character, would account for an unconscious and not intentionally
dishonest transference of the stirring events of earlier days to a
date at which their narrator could have personally participated in
them; there is no one so easily deceived by a Greek as himself,
and no one half so honestly. Yet on the whole I incline to believe
the story.</p>

<p>Fortunately the chronological exactitude and detailed precision
of the story do not much matter. Accurate or inaccurate in itself
it contains a clear expression of the view held by the old peasant
of the purpose of human sacrifice. ‘We thought things over and
decided to send a man to St Nicolas to ask him that our ships
might prosper in the war.’ This is our text, and its very terseness
and directness of expression prove how familiar and native to the
speaker’s mind was this aspect of sacrifice. The human victim
was simply and solely a messenger. St Nicolas, to whom he was
sent, has supplanted Poseidon, as has been remarked above<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>, in
the government of the sea and the patronage of sailors; but how
he came to be associated with the hall which was deemed a right
place for the sacrifice, unless perhaps he had succeeded to the
possession of the site of some temple of Poseidon, I cannot say.
It is of little avail to press for further elucidation of a peasant’s
story. I would gladly have learnt more about the hall now wholly
buried but then partially at least visible above ground, into which
none the less a descent by steps is mentioned; I would gladly have
learnt more about the appearance of God with a bright torch in
his hand, and what was the significance to the peasant’s mind of
the appearance of God himself<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> (<span class="greek">ὁ θεός</span>) instead of St Nicolas
to whom the messenger was sent. These uncertainties and obscurities
must remain. The only additional fact which I elicited
was that the man taken and sent to St Nicolas was in Greek
parlance a ‘Christian,’ that is to say neither a Turk nor a member
of the Roman Church which has long held a footing in the island.
There was therefore no admixture of either racial or religious
hatred in the feelings which prompted, as it is alleged, this
human sacrifice.</p>

<p>If then the story be accepted, the motive assigned must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
accepted with it; but if the story be discredited, the motive
assigned has still a value. For even if the old man had deliberately
invented the tale and claimed complicity in so ghastly a deed,
whence could he have obtained that conception of human sacrifice
which furnished the motive of the action? It is inconceivable
that he should have evolved the idea from personal meditations
on the subject of sacrifice. It is equally inconceivable that he
could have obtained it from any literary source; for he could not
read, and the only book of which he could have had any knowledge
would have been the Bible, to which this view of sacrifice
is unknown. The only source from which he could have received
the idea is native and oral tradition.</p>

<p>So distinct an expression of the idea is naturally rare, because
human sacrifice is not an every-day topic of conversation among
peasantry; but such a theory of sacrifice is perfectly harmonious
with that chord of Greek religion of which several notes have
already been struck. To obey dreams, to enquire of oracles, to
observe birds, to hear omens in chance words, to read divine
messages in the flesh of sacrificial victims, to make presents to the
powers above for the purpose of securing blessings or averting
wrath&mdash;these are the ways of a people from whose mind the
primitive belief in close contact and converse with their gods has
not been expelled by the invasion of education; whose religion
has not paid the price of ennobling its conceptions and elevating
its ideals by making the worshipper feel too acutely his debasement
and his distance from the godhead; whose instinctive
judgement divides the domain of faith from the domain of reason,
and accepts poetical beauty rather than logical probability as
the evidence of things unseen. True indeed it is that of all
the practices by which this people’s belief in intercourse with
their gods is attested none is so remarkable as acquiescence
or complicity in murder prompted solely by the belief that the
victim by passing the gates of death can carry a message in
person to one in whose power the future lies. But all that is
painful and gruesome in such a deed only accentuates the more
the unflinching faith of a people who, not in blind devotion to
custom nor in fear of a prophet’s command, but intelligently and
of piety prepense, could sacrifice a compatriot and co-religionist
to ensure the safe carriage of their most urgent prayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span></p>

<p>If tragedy consists in the conflict of deep emotions, and
religion in obeying the divine rather than the human, few deeds
have been more tragic, none more religious than this. In that
scene at Aulis when the warrior-king gave up his child at the
prophet’s bidding to stay the wrath of Artemis against his host,
the tragedy was indeed intensified by the strength of the human
tie between the sacrificer and the victim; but blind and awe-struck
submission to a prophet’s decree is less grandly religious
than clear-sighted recognition and courageous application of the
belief that the dead pass immediately into the very presence of
the gods. Here are the two given conditions: first, the urgency
of the present or the peril of the future requires that a request for
help be safely conveyed at all costs to that god or saint in whose
province the control of the danger lies; secondly, the safest way of
sending a message to that god or saint is by the mouth of a
human messenger whose road is over the pass of death. There is
only one solution of that problem. And if it is true that only
some eighty years ago the problem was solved at so cruel a cost,
then the faith of this people in their communion with those on
whose knees the future lies is more intense, more vital, more
courageous than that of more Western nations whose religion has
long been subordinated or at least allied to morality, and whose
acts of worship are all well-regulated and eminently decorous.</p>

<p>Human sacrifice is known to have been practised in ancient
Greece and the custom probably continued well into the Christian
era. What was the motive which prompted the continuance of so
cruel a rite? Was it the same as that which the old peasant of
Santorini assigned for the performance of a like act in his own
experience&mdash;that conception of the victim as a messenger with
which he can have been familiar only from native and oral
tradition? Assuredly some strong religious motive must have
compelled the ancients to a rite which in the absence of such
motive would have been an indelible stigma upon their civilisation,
refuting all their claims to emancipation of thought and freedom
of intellect, and branding them the very bond-slaves of grossest
superstition. Even though they lived on the marches of the East
where human life is of small account, the horror of the rite is in
too vivid a contrast with Hellenic enlightenment for us to see in
it a mere callous retention of an unmeaning and savage custom;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
but that horror is at least mitigated if underlying the practice
there was some deep religious motive, if a genuine faith in the
possibility of direct intercourse with heaven exalted above the
sacredness of human life the sacred privilege of sending a messenger
to present the whole people’s petition before their god.</p>

<p>But while it is easy to perceive that such a motive is in
harmony with that belief in the possibility of the communion of
man with God which is so pronounced a feature in the religion
of the ancient Greeks no less than in that of their descendants,
it is a far harder task actually, to prove that this motive was
the one acknowledged justification for human sacrifice. Ancient
literature is extremely reticent on the whole subject; the very
fact of the existence of the rite is known chiefly from late writers,
Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>, Porphyry<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>, and Tzetzes<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>; and anything like a discussion
of the motives which underlay it is nowhere to be found. This
reticence however was prompted, we may suppose, simply and
solely by the patent barbarity of the act; it in no way impugns
the latent beauty of the motive. Rather the persistence in a rite
which did violence to men’s humaner feelings and moral sense
proves the strength of the appeal which the motive for it must
have addressed to their religious convictions. There was no place
for shame in the belief that death was the road by which alone
a human messenger could gain immediate access to the gods; but
if a messenger were required to go at regular intervals, the regular
occurrence of deaths required murder. This, I think, was the cause
of shame and reticence.</p>

<p>Now if this very simple analysis of the feelings which almost
barred the discussion or even mention of human sacrifice by
ancient authors is correct, we should expect to find that, where
death occurred naturally and not by human intervention, the conception
of the dying or the dead as messengers to the unseen
world would find ready and unembarrassed expression. And
especially is this to be expected among the Greeks with whom
grief has never imposed a check upon garrulity, but rather the
loudness of the lamentation has always been the test of the
poignancy of the sorrow. It is therefore in funeral-dirges and
such-like that we must look for the expression of this idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span></p>

<p>An organised ceremony of lamentation is at the present day
an essential part of every Greek funeral, and many dirges sung
on such occasions have been collected and published. In these
the conception of the departed as a messenger, or even as a carrier
of goods, abounds<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>. A Laconian dirge runs thus: ‘A prudent lady,
a virtuous wife, willed and resolved to go down to Hades.
“Whoso has words” (she cried) “let him say them, and messages,
let him send them; whoso has a son there unarmed, let him send
his arms; whoso has son there a scribe, let him send his papers;
whoso has daughter undowered, let him send her dowry; whoso
has a little child, let him send his swaddling clothes.”’<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p>The same thought inspires a dirge in Passow’s collection<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>, in
which the thoughts of a dead man, round whose body the women
are sitting and weeping, are thus expressed: ‘Why stand ye
round about me, all ye sorrowing women? Have I come forth
from Hades, forth from the world below? Nay, now am I making
ready, now am I at the point to go. Whoso hath word, let him
speak it, and message, let him tell it; whoso hath long complaint,
let him write and send it.’ And again in another funeral-song a
dead man is described as a ‘trusty courier bound for the world
below<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>.’</p>

<p>This sentiment, so frequently and so clearly expressed in the
modern dirges, is of ancient descent. Polyxena, about to be
sacrificed at Achilles’ tomb, is made by Euripides to address to
her mother the question, ‘What am I to say from thee to Hector
or to thy aged husband?’, and Hecuba answers, ‘My message is
that I am of all women most miserable<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>.’ And it is the same
genuinely Hellenic thought which Vergil attributes to Neoptolemus
when he answers Priam’s taunts of degeneracy with the
words, ‘These tidings then thou shalt carry, and shalt go as
messenger to my sire, the son of Peleus; forget not to tell him of
my sorry deeds and that Neoptolemus is no true son. Now die<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>.’</p>

<p>And it is not only in the poetry of ancient and modern Greece
but also in the actual customs of the people that this idea has found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
expression. At the present day funerals are constantly treated
by the peasants as real opportunities of communicating with their
dead friends and relatives. Whether the custom is ever carried out
exactly as it once was by the Galatae, who used to write letters to
the departed and to lay them on the pyre of each new courier to
the lower world<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>, I cannot definitely say; but a proverbial expression
used of a person dangerously ill, <span class="greek">μαζεύει γράμματα γιὰ
τοὺς πεθαμμένους</span>, ‘he is collecting letters for the dead,’ lends
colour to the supposition that either now or in earlier days this
form of the custom is or has been in vogue. But in general now
certainly the messages are not written but verbal. It is a common
custom, noticed by many writers on Greek folklore<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>, for the women
who assist in the ceremonial lamentation which precedes the interment
to insert in the dirges, which they each in turn contribute,
messages which they require the newly-dead to deliver to some
departed person whom they name, or, according to a slightly
different usage, to whisper such messages secretly in the ear of
the dead either immediately before the body is borne away to
the church<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>, or, where women are allowed to attend the actual
interment, at the moment of ‘the last kiss’ (<span class="greek">ὁ τελευταῖος
ἀσπασμός</span>), which forms an essential and very painful part of
the Eastern rite.</p>

<p>The antiquity of this custom appears to me to be as certain
as anything which is not explicitly stated in ancient literature
can be. For in every detail of ancient funeral usage known to us
there is so complete a coincidence with modern usage that it
would be absurd not to supplement records of the past by observation
of the present. Actually to establish that identity in
every particular is beyond the scope of the present chapter and must
be reserved until later; but my assertion may be justified here
by reference to three points in Solon’s legislation on the subject
of funerals. That legislation was directed against three practices
to which mourners were addicted in this ceremonial lamentation
of which I have been speaking&mdash;laceration of the cheeks and
breast, the use of set and premeditated dirges, and lamentation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
for any other than him whose funeral was in progress<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>&mdash;customs
which all still flourish.</p>

<p>The laceration is quite a common feature of such occasions.
Indeed in some districts the women nearest of kin to the deceased
are almost thought to fail in their duty to him if they do not
work themselves up into an hysterical mood and testify to the
wildness of their grief by tearing out their hair and scratching
their cheeks till the blood flows. Such a display of agony, it
must be remembered, comes easy to the Greeks: for their temperament
is such that, even when the fact of the bereavement has
moved them little, the <i>rôle</i> of the bereaved excites them to the most
dramatic excesses. Men rarely if ever now take part in this
scene, and are certainly not guilty of such transports; for their
usual method of mourning is to let their hair grow instead
of tearing it out, and to avoid laceration by forswearing the
razor.</p>

<p>Again, the use of set dirges, composed or adapted beforehand
to suit the estate and circumstances of the deceased, is
almost universal; and so essential to the funeral-rite is the formal
lamentation that there are actually women whose profession it
is to intone dirges and who are hired for the occasion. These
professional mourners (<span class="greek">μυρολογήτριαις</span> or <span class="greek">μυρολογίστριαις</span>) take
their seats round the corpse in order of seniority and assist the
wife, mother, sisters, cousins, and aunts, who also take their seats
according to degree of kinship (the head of the bier being of
course the place of honour), to keep up an incessant flow of
lamentation. The scene differs in no detail, save that the hired
mourners now are always women, from that which was enacted
round the body of Hector. There too ‘they set singers to lead
the lamentation,’ and of the women present it was Andromache,
the wife, who began the wailing, Hecuba, the mother, who followed
next, and Helen whose voice was heard third and last<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>.
The singers who led the lamentation were probably then as now
hired, for Plato speaks of paid minstrels at funerals using a particular
style of music known as Carian<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>&mdash;a custom suggestive of
antiquity; and in all probability the singing of set dirges, which
Solon tried to suppress, was the recognised business of professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
and paid mourners; for dirges premeditated by the relatives would
have been less objectionable, one may suppose, than their hysterical
improvisations. What success his legislation obtained in Athens
cannot now be ascertained; but the custom was undoubtedly
universal in Greece, and with the exception of the Ionian islands,
where the Venetians imitated Solon in sternly repressing what
they regarded as a scandal and a grave offence against public
decency<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>, all parts of Greece still to some extent retain it; and
it is likely long to survive for the simple reason that lamentation
has always been held by the Greeks to be as essential to the
repose of the dead as burial. There is more than hazard in the
repeated collocation of <span class="greek">ἄκλαυτος, ἄταφος</span>, ‘unwept, unburied,’ in
the tragedians<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>; there is the religious idea that the dead need a
twofold rite, both mourning and interment.</p>

<p>The third point in the funeral customs to which Solon demurred
was that mourners attending the ceremony of lamentation
misused the occasion by wailing again for their own dead
and neglecting him whose death had brought them together.
This practice was known to the Homeric age; for while Briseïs
‘tore with her hands her breast and smooth neck and fair face’
and with shrill wailing and tears made lament over Patroclus,
‘the women joined their groans to hers, for Patroclus in form, but
each really for their own losses<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>.’ There is no intention of satire
here; it is simply a naïve touch in the picture of a familiar and
pathetic scene. Patroclus’ death furnished the excuse and the
occasion for tears, but most of those tears&mdash;pent up till they might
flow freely and without shame&mdash;were shed for nearer sorrows,
dearer losses. To-day the manner is the same. In some districts,
as in Chios<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>, a woman’s desire to lament again over her own dead
is recognised as so legitimate that etiquette merely prescribes
that she first must make mention of the present dead and afterwards
she is free to mourn for whom she will; and indeed
throughout Greece the opportunity for rehearsing former sorrows
is rarely neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span></p>

<p>Now when in these details that have been enumerated (as well
as in many others such as the washing, arraying, and crowning
of the dead body, the antiquity of which will be treated in
another chapter<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>) that portion of ancient usage which is known
from literary sources is found surviving, point for point identical,
as a portion of modern usage, then the defect of ancient literary
sources is best and most reasonably supplemented from present
observations. Thus we know from the <i>Iliad</i> that the women of
the Homeric age used Patroclus’ funeral as an occasion for renewing
their wailing over their own losses; we know too from Plutarch
that in Solon’s age the same practice had attained such excessive
proportions that legislation intervened to check it; the only
detail which we are not told is whether the mourners in commemorating
thus their own dead friends were wont to entrust messages
for them to him about whose bier they were assembled. But when
the ancient picture of funeral-usage corresponds thus in every
distinguishable trait with the living scenes of to-day, clearly the
right way of restoring that which is obscured or obliterated in the
picture is to go and to see still enacted in all its traditional fulness
that very scene which the remnants of ancient literature imperfectly
pourtray. And by going and seeing we learn this&mdash;that
one strongly marked characteristic of funeral-rites is the belief,
both expressed in words and evidenced in acts, that he whose
death has brought the mourners together is a messenger who can
and will carry tidings to those who have preceded him to the
world below. Then on looking back we may feel confident that
that aspect of death, which prompted Polyxena to ask what
message she should bear from Hecuba to Hector and to Priam,
was no mere poetic conceit imagined by Euripides, but a common
feature of the popular religion. The belief that the passing spirit
is a sure and unerring messenger to another world has ever been
the property of the Hellenic people.</p>

<p>Since then this belief existed in ancient times and the practice
of human sacrifice also existed, it remains to enquire whether the
two were correlated as cause and effect, as in my story from
Santorini. In this enquiry the reticence of ancient literature on
the subject precludes, as I have pointed out, actual certainty; but
a passage from Herodotus offers a clue which is worth following up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span></p>
<p>In speaking of the Getae, a Thracian people, he remarks that
they believe in their own immortality. ‘They hold that they themselves
do not die, but the departed go to dwell with a god named
Zalmoxis.... And every four years they choose one of their own
number by lot and despatch him as messenger to Zalmoxis, enjoining
upon him the delivery of their various requests. The manner of
sending him is this. Some of them are set to hold up three
spears, while others take their emissary by his arms and by his
legs and swinging him up into the air let him fall upon the
spear-points. If he be pierced by them mortally, they consider
that their god is favourable to them; but if death do not result,
they lay the blame on the messenger himself and give him a bad
name; but having censured him they despatch another man
instead. Their injunctions are given to the messenger before he
is killed<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>.’</p>

<p>Now no one can fail to notice that Herodotus’ own interest in
this custom centres not in the idea which prompted it but in the
manner of carrying it out. His account of it reads as if he knew
his Greek readers to be familiar enough with the conception of
human sacrifice as a means of sending a messenger to some god;
but he seems to be contrasting the method adopted with some
rite of which they were cognisant. Tacit comparisons of foreign
customs with those of Greece occur all through Herodotus’ work.
The points which he here seems to emphasize are, first, that
the messenger of the Getae was one of themselves, not a prisoner
of war or a slave; secondly, that impaling was the ritual mode of
death&mdash;a mode which the Greeks held in abhorrence and would
never have employed; and, thirdly, that the messages were committed
to the victim’s charge before and not after death. The
inference therefore is that Herodotus and the Greeks for whom he
was writing were accustomed to some rite which was inspired by
the same motive but was differently executed, the messenger
being other than a citizen, the method of sacrifice less barbarous
to their minds than impaling, and the messages being whispered,
as at funerals, in the dead victim’s ear; for of course, if the newly-dead
could carry tidings to men in the other world, they could
equally well carry petitions to gods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span></p>
<p>Moreover my contention that Herodotus had in mind some
Greek rite, with which he was contrasting that of the Getae, is
borne out by the passage immediately following, in which the idea
of comparison comes to the surface. This Zalmoxis, he continues,
according to the Greeks of the Hellespont and the Euxine, was in
origin not a god but a man. He served for a time as a slave to
Pythagoras in Samos, but having gained his liberty and considerable
wealth returned to Thrace and tried to reclaim his
countrymen from savagery and ignorance. The ways of life and
the doctrines which he inculcated were such as he had derived
from intercourse with Greeks and above all with Pythagoras,
whose teachings concerning immortality and a future life in a
happier land he both preached and (by the trick of hiding himself
for three years in a subterranean chamber and then re-appearing
to those who had believed him dead) illustrated in his own person.
This story is neither accepted nor rejected by Herodotus, but,
estimating Zalmoxis to have been of much earlier date than
Pythagoras, he inclines slightly to the view that Zalmoxis was
really a native god of the Getae.</p>

<p>If we may assume this view to be correct, what significance
is to be attached to the story of Zalmoxis’ relations with
Pythagoras? Evidently it is one of those fictions by which the
ancient Greeks loved to bring the great figures of history into
contact and personal acquaintance. Pythagoras and Zalmoxis were
two names with which was associated the doctrine of immortality;
some story therefore of their meeting was desirable. And since
Pythagoras was Greek, Zalmoxis barbarian, the legend that the
slave Zalmoxis was instructed by his master Pythagoras was more
flattering to Hellenic pride than the idea that Pythagoras in his
travels should have borrowed so important a doctrine from a foreign
religion; and if chronology did not concur&mdash;well, imagination
always had precedence of accuracy. To the Greeks who invented
the tale fitness was of more account than fact; and for us who
dismiss the actual story as mere fiction their sense of its fitness
remains instructive. It shows that the Greeks recognised the
existence of specially close relations between the religion of the
Getae and their own&mdash;relations attested probably not only by their
common acceptance of the doctrine of immortality, for that was
the property of other peoples too, but also by some resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
between the rites of the Getae which were based upon that
doctrine and similar rites practised, as Herodotus hints, by themselves.</p>

<p>Then again if the motive which we have found operating in
Herodotus’ time among the Getae and operating also less than
a century ago among the peasants of Santorini was not the
motive which prompted the ancient Greeks to human sacrifice,
how can we account for the long perpetuation of the practice? It
is practically certain that it was tolerated in Athens during the
period of her ascendency and highest enlightenment<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>; but the
repugnance which it inspired is proved by the reticence which
almost concealed the fact from posterity. It was practised
apparently in honour of Lycaean Zeus in the time of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>;
but the horror of it closed his lips concerning this ‘secret sacrifice.’
Suppose then that the motive for this sacrifice had been the sating
of a wolf-like god&mdash;for so Pausanias seems to have understood the
epithet <span class="greek">Λυκαῖος</span><a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>&mdash;with human flesh; could such a rite have
continued in any part of Greece for some six centuries after it had
become repugnant at least in Athens? Was the supposed motive
so sublime that it was held to hallow or even to mitigate the
barbarity of the act? Or did the custom live on without motive
when an anthropomorphic Zeus had superseded the old wolf-like
deity? Custom, it is true, often outlives its parent belief; but
custom itself is not invulnerable nor deathless if it has to battle
against sentiments irreconcilably opposed to that original belief.
If the purpose of propitiating a wolf-god with human flesh was
rendered null and void by the modifications which the conception
of Lycaean Zeus had undergone, how could the crude and savage
rite have still flourished in the uncongenial soil of an humaner
civilisation&mdash;unless of course some new stream of religious thought,
instead of the original motive, had watered and revived it? The
very fact that so hideous a custom was so long maintained in
civilised Greece argues that, whatever the original motive of it
may have been, only some strong religious belief in the necessity
of it could have saved it from extinction in the historical age.
Surely it was some convincing plea of justification, and not mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
acquiescence in the inveteracy of custom, which caused Pausanias,
though he could not bring himself to describe or to discuss the
horrid sacrifice, yet to conclude his brief allusion to it with the
words, ‘as it was in the beginning and is now, so let it be<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>.’</p>

<p>My reasons then for suggesting that one motive which led to
human sacrifice in ancient Greece was the belief that the victim
could carry a petition in person to the gods are threefold. First,
that motive was recognised as sufficient by a peasant of Santorini,
who can only have inherited the idea, just as all the ideas of
divination have been inherited, from the ancient world. Secondly,
Herodotus appears to contrast the method of such sacrifice among
the Getae with the method of some similar rite familiar to his
audience and to imply that the motive in each case was the same.
Thirdly, without an adequate motive&mdash;and it is hard to see what
other motive could have been adequate in the case which I have
taken&mdash;it is almost inconceivable that human sacrifice should
have continued, in spite of the repugnance which it certainly
excited, for so long a time. For these reasons I submit that the
known belief of the ancients that the dead could serve as messengers
to the other world and their known custom of making
human sacrifice were correlated in the minds of thinking men in
the more civilised ages as cause and effect.</p>

<p>The reservation, ‘in the minds of thinking men in the more
civilised ages,’ is necessary; for I am at a loss how to determine
whether the belief in question was the original motive of the
custom or a later justification of the custom when its original
motive had been forgotten. Either the belief was coeval with the
custom, and both were inherited together from ancestors belonging
to that ‘lower barbaric stage’ of culture in which ‘men do not
stop short at the persuasion that death releases the soul to a free
and active existence, but they quite logically proceed to assist
nature by slaying men in order to liberate their souls for ghostly
uses<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>’; or on the other hand the custom of human sacrifice
originated in some other motive (such as satisfying the appetite of
a beast-like god) and remaining itself unchanged, while the conception
of the god was gradually humanised until his beast-form
and therewith the original purpose of the sacrifice were lost to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
memory, embarrassed a more enlightened and humaner age until a
new justification for it was found in the messenger-functions of
the dead.</p>

<p>In support of the former supposition it may be mentioned that
tribes far more barbarous than the Getae (who may have benefited
from Greek civilisation) have evolved the particular ghostly use of
dead men’s souls which we are considering. In Dahome, according
to Captain Burton, not only are a large number of wives, eunuchs,
singers, drummers, and soldiers slaughtered at the king’s funeral,
that they may wait on him in another world, but ‘whatever action,
however trivial, is performed by the (new) king, it must dutifully be
reported to his sire in the shadowy realm. A victim, almost always
a war-captive, is chosen; the message is delivered to him, an
intoxicating draught of rum follows it, and he is dispatched to
Hades in the best of humours<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>.’ There is therefore no objection
to the supposition that the Hellenic people too from the days of
prehistoric savagery were constantly actuated by this motive.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is equally admissible to think that some
cruder motive first led the population of Greece to adopt the custom
of human sacrifice, and that it was only comparatively late in their
history, in an age when men’s humaner instincts were offended by
the atrocity of the rite and religious speculation on the subject of
the soul’s immortality was rife, that the old custom was invested
with a new meaning. Herodotus clearly recognised the connexion
between the rite of the Getae and the doctrine of immortality
which was bound up with the names of Zalmoxis and Pythagoras;
and it is possible that in Greece too the later justification of
human sacrifice was founded on the same doctrine. It would
have been an irony of fate truly if a doctrine not indeed founded,
I think, but largely expounded by Pythagoras, who forbade his
followers to kill even animals for the purposes of food, should have
been so construed as to furnish a plea for the immolation of men;
but it is quite clear that a belief in the activity of the soul after
death, superimposed upon the desire for close communion between
men and gods, might have had that issue.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, I see no means of deciding at what date
the correlation of the conception of the dead as messengers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
the custom of human sacrifice as cause and effect first entered
men’s minds; but that in the historical age that correlation was
acknowledged seems to me highly probable. Such a view would
certainly have militated against the substitution of animal for
human victims; for only a man would have been felt to be capable
of understanding the message and of delivering it to the god to
whom he was sent. This perhaps is the reason why the use of a
surrogate animal&mdash;though early introduced, as one version of the
story of Iphigenia proves&mdash;never met with universal acceptance,
and why also at the present day there remains a vague but real
feeling that for the proper laying of foundations a human victim
is preferable to beast or bird<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>.</p>

<p>To single out particular instances of ancient sacrifice in which
this motive may have operated is, owing to the general absence of
data concerning the ritual, well-nigh impossible. The sacrifice to
Lycaean Zeus was performed upon an altar before which, according
to Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>, there stood two columns and upon them two gilded
eagles; and we may surmise that as the eagles represented to his
mind the messengers sent by Zeus to men, so did the human
victim represent the messenger of men to Zeus. But this can be
only a conjecture, for Pausanias’ silence admits of no more.</p>

<p>Of the ceremony connected with the <i>pharmakos</i>, or human
scape-goat, at Athens and elsewhere somewhat more is known.
Certain persons ungainly in appearance and debased in character
were maintained at the public expense, in order that, if any
calamity such as a pestilence should befall the city, they might be
sacrificed to purify the city from pollution. These persons were
called <span class="greek">φαρμακοί</span>, ‘scape-goats,’ or <span class="greek">καθάρματα</span>, ‘purifications<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>.’ ‘If
calamity overtook a city through divine wrath, whether it were
famine or pestilence or any other bane,’ a <i>pharmakos</i> was led out to
an appointed place for sacrifice. Cheese, barley-cake, and dried figs
were given to him. He was smitten seven times on the privy
parts with squills and wild figs and other wild plants; and finally
he was burnt with fire upon fuel collected from wild trees, and
the ashes were scattered to the winds and the sea<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>. At Athens,
it appears, this rite was performed, not under the stress of oc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>casional
calamity, but annually as part of the <i>Thargelia</i>, and was
therefore associated with Apollo<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>.</p>

<p>All this evidence, with corroboration from other sources than
those to which I have referred, has recently been set forth by
Miss Harrison, who certainly has made out a strong case for the
view which she thus summarises: ‘The leading out of the
<i>pharmakos</i> is then a purely magical ceremony based on ignorance
and fear; it is not a human sacrifice to Apollo or to any other
divinity or even ghost, it is a ceremony of physical expulsion<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>.’
In other words, the <i>pharmakos</i> was treated as an incarnation of
the polluting influence from which the city was suffering; and his
expulsion (which only incidentally involved his death) was the
means of purification.</p>

<p>But there are certain points in the practice which incline me
to put forward another view of the <i>pharmakos</i>. His mission undoubtedly
was to purify the city; but the question to my mind is
whether he was expelled as a personification of the pollution or
was led out and despatched to the other world as a messenger on
the city’s behalf to petition Apollo or some other deity for purification
from the defilement.</p>

<p>It might, I think, have been this Greek rite which was present
to Herodotus’ mind when he was describing human sacrifice
among the Getae. He was apparently familiar, we saw, with the
conception of the human victim as a messenger; and the contrasts
in method which seem to have struck him most would certainly
have been provided by the ceremony of the <i>pharmakos</i>. The
Getae chose the victim by lot from among themselves; the
Athenians apparently selected some deformed or criminal slave&mdash;one
of the very scum of the population. The Getae impaled their
messenger upon the spears of warriors; the Athenians treated the
<i>pharmakos</i> as a burnt-sacrifice. The Getae entrusted their messages
to the victim before he was slain; did the Athenians perchance
whisper their petitions for purification in the ear of the dead
<i>pharmakos</i> as he lay on the pyre? Was he the messenger whose
treatment Herodotus had in mind?</p>

<p>There are certain points in the ritual itself which make for that
view. The <i>pharmakos</i> was maintained for a time at the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
cost. Why so? A kindred custom of Marseilles in ancient times
supplies the answer. ‘Whenever the inhabitants of Marseilles
suffer from a pestilence, one of the poorer class offers himself to
be kept at the public expense and fed on specially pure foods.
After this has been done he is decorated with sacred boughs and
clad in holy garments, and led about through the whole city to
the accompaniment of curses, in order that upon him may fall all
the ills of the whole city, and thus he is cast headlong down<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>.’
The <i>pharmakos</i> was therefore publicly maintained in order that
he might be purified by diet. Again, we know, the <i>pharmakos</i>
was provided before the sacrifice with cheese, barley-cake, and
dried figs&mdash;pure food, it would seem, with which to sustain himself
on his journey to the other world. Again, he was smitten
seven times on the privy parts with squills and branches of wild fig
and other wild plants. Why with squill and wild fig? Because
plants of this kind were purgative, as Miss Harrison<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> very clearly
points out. Among other evidences of the existence of this idea,
Lucian<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> makes Menippus relate how before he was allowed to
consult the oracle of the dead he was “purged and wiped clean and
consecrated with squill and torches.” And why on the privy parts?
Because sexual purity was required. When Creon was bidden to
sacrifice a son for the salvation of his city in a time of calamity such
as commonly called for the sacrifice of a <i>pharmakos</i>, Haemon was
refused because of his marriage<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>, and Menoeceus was the only
pure victim. And why beaten at all? Because again, as Miss
Harrison shows<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>, the act of beating was expulsive of evil and
pollution. So then the chief part of the ritual was devoted to
purifying the <i>pharmakos</i> himself.</p>

<p>But if the <i>pharmakos</i> was thus himself made pure, how could
his expulsion purify the city? How could a man deliberately
cleansed by every religious or magical device serve as the embodiment
of that pollution of which the city sought to be rid? Miss
Harrison<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> seeks to explain this difficulty on the grounds of that
combination of the notions ‘sacred’ and ‘accursed,’ ‘pure’ and
‘impure,’ which the savage describes in the word ‘taboo.’ But
the notion of ‘taboo,’ though complex, is not illogical; anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
supernatural, which when properly used or respected is holy, is
logically enough believed to be fraught with a curse for those who
misuse or disregard it. But deliberately to purify that which is
to be the embodiment of defilement is not the outcome of a
complex but logical primitive notion; it is simply illogical.</p>

<p>The view of the rite then which I propose is briefly this. The
<i>pharmakos</i> was originally a messenger, representative of a whole
people, carrying to some god their petition for deliverance from
any great calamity; and, that he might be fitted to enter the
presence of the god, he was purified, like Menippus before he was
allowed to approach even an oracle, by every known means. But
the office of <i>pharmakos</i> did not always remain a post of honour.
It was naturally not coveted by those who found any pleasure in
life; and gradually the duty devolved upon the lowest of the low.
Instead of an Iphigenia or a Menoeceus the people’s chosen
representative was some criminal or slave, and the personality
of the messenger overshadowed the character of his office. The
original purport of the rite was forgotten. Instead of being
honoured as the people’s ambassador, specially purified for his
mission of intercession with the gods, he was deemed an outcast
by whose removal the people could rid themselves of pollution.
Thus the religious rite lost its true motive and degenerated into a
magical ceremony of riddance.</p>

<p>That this debased idea was the vulgar interpretation of the
rite in historical Athens is absolutely proved by a passage from
Lysias’ speech against Andocides: ‘We needs must hold that in
avenging ourselves and ridding ourselves of Andocides we purify
the city and perform apotropaic ceremonies and solemnly expel a
<i>pharmakos</i> and rid ourselves of a criminal; for of this sort the
fellow is<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>.’ But the whole ritual forms a protest against that idea.
Its keynote was the sanctification, not the degradation, of the
<i>pharmakos</i>. In Marseilles indeed the people’s change of attitude
towards the messenger whom they so scrupulously purified had
gone so far that imprecations upon him were substituted for the
prayers which he should have been bidden to carry; but in
Athens and in Ionia the ritual itself, so far as we know, contained
no suggestion of contempt or hatred of the victim. It was only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
the appearance and the character of those who were selected as
<i>pharmakoi</i> which made of the word a term of vulgar abuse such as
we find it to be in Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>; for the scattering of the victim’s
ashes to the winds and waves must not be interpreted as an act
denoting any abhorrence of the dead man. Its significance is rather
this. Religious motives had involved an act of bloodshed, and the
people who had performed it as a religious duty were, like
Orestes, none the less guilty of blood. In any case of blood-guilt
it was held prudent for the guilty party to take precautions
against his victim’s vengeance; and one means to this end was, as
we shall see later, to burn the body and scatter its ashes. In the
modern story from Santorini there is a precaution mentioned
which has precisely the same object; the victim’s hands, as well
as his head, were cut off. This, as I shall show later, is a survival
of the old <span class="greek">μασχαλισμός</span> or mutilation of murdered men, by which
they were rendered innocuous, if they should return from the
grave, and incapable of vengeance upon their murderers. There
is then, I repeat, nothing in the ritual itself which suggests any
contempt or hatred of the victim, as there assuredly would have
been if from the first he had been the incarnation of the city’s
defilement.</p>

<p>Possibly then the <i>pharmakos</i> was originally a messenger from
men to gods, sent in any time of great calamity and peril; possibly
too this significance of the rite had not in Herodotus’ time been
wholly supplanted by the lower view to which Lysias gave utterance.
Lysias was addressing a jury and abusing an opponent; a vulgar
and base presentment of the <i>pharmakos</i> suited the occasion. But
sober and reflective men may still have read in the ritual its early
meaning and have recognised in the <i>pharmakos</i>, for all his sorry
appearance, the purified representative of a people sent by them
to lay their prayers before some god.</p>

<p>This, I am aware, is a suggestion and no more. To prove the
existence of this motive underlying any given case of human
sacrifice in ancient times is, owing to the meagre character of the
data, impossible. But since at any rate the conception of the
dead as messengers was known to the ancients&mdash;for that much, I
think, I have proved&mdash;the suggestion deserves consideration. If
it be right, it shows that even the most ugly and repulsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
ceremonies of Greek worship need not be regarded as damning
refutation of the beauty of Greek religion. Though the act of
human sacrifice is horrible, the motive for it may have been
sublime. Where else in the civilised world is the faith which
whispers messages in a dead ear? Who shall cast the first stone
at those who in this faith dared to speed their messenger upon the
road of death? Surely such a deed is the crowning act of a faith
which by dreams and oracles, by auspices and sacrificial omens,
has ever sought after communion with the gods.</p>

<p>Yet no, that faith aspired even higher; another chapter will treat
of a sacrament which foreshadowed not merely the colloquy of men
with gods as of servants with masters, but a closer communion
between them, the communion of love; for, as Plato says in the
text which heads this chapter, ‘all sacrifices and all the arts of
divination, wherein consists the mutual communion of gods and
men, are for nought else but the guarding and tending of Love.’</p>

<span class="smaller">THE RELATION OF SOUL AND BODY.</span></h2>
</div>


<h3 class="nobreak">§ 1. <span class="smcap">The Modern Greek Vampire.</span></h3>

<p>The division of the human entity into the two parts which
we call soul and body has been so universally recognised even
among the most primitive of mankind that the idea of it must
have been first suggested by the observation of some universal
phenomenon&mdash;most probably the phenomenon of unconsciousness
whether in sleep, in fainting, in trance, or in death. If it had
been man’s lot to pass in this world a life of activity unbroken
by sleep or exhaustion, and thereafter to be translated like
Enoch or Ganymede to another world, so that the spectacle of
a body lying inert and senseless could never have been forced
upon men’s sight, the first impulse to speculation concerning
that impalpable something, the loss of which severs men from
converse with the waking, active world, might never have been
given, and the duality of human nature might never have been
conceived. But death above all overtaking each in turn has
forced in turn the mourners for each to muse on the future
condition of these two elements which, united, make a man,
and, disjoined, leave but a corpse. Does neither or does one or
do both of them continue? And, continuing, what degree of
intelligence and of power has either or have both? Are they
for ever separated, or will they be re-united elsewhere? Such are
the questions that must have vexed, as they still vex, the minds
of many when their eyes were confronted by the spectacle of
death.</p>

<p>For some indeed a means of answering or of quieting such
searchings of heart has been found in the acceptance of religious
dogma. But ancient Greek religion, the faith or superstition in
which the Hellenic people, defiant alike of destructive and of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>structive
philosophy, lived and moved and had their being, was
not dogmatic; the very priests were guardians and exponents of
ceremonies rather than preachers of doctrine; there was no organised
hierarchy committed to one set creed and prepared to
assert the divine revelation of a single formulated answer to
these questions. The sum total of orthodoxy amounted to little
more than a belief in gods; and each man was free to believe
what he would, evil as well as good, concerning them, and to
find for himself hope or despair. In determining therefore the
views to which the mass of the common-folk inclined with regard to
the relations of soul and body, little assistance can be obtained in
the first instance from those personal opinions which literature
has preserved to us, opinions emanating from poets and philosophers
who were not of the people but consciously above them,
and who set themselves some to expose, others to reform, the
popular religion, but few simply to maintain it. The conservative
force of the ancient religion lay in the inherited and almost
instinctive beliefs of the common-folk; oral tradition weighed
more with them than philosophic reasoning, and their tenacity
of customs as barbarous even as human sacrifice defied the softening
influences of an humaner civilisation.</p>

<p>That these characteristics of the ancient Greek folk are stamped
equally upon the people of to-day is a fact which every page of
this book has confirmed; and it is therefore by analysis of modern
beliefs and customs relative to death that I propose to discover
the fundamental ideas held by the Greek people from the
beginning concerning the relations between soul and body. For
I venture to think that the great teachers of antiquity, whose
doctrines dominate ancient literature, were often more widely
removed by their genius, than are the modern folk by the lapse of
centuries, from the peasants of those early days, and that the oral
tradition of a people who have instinctively clung to every ancient
belief and custom is even after more than two thousand years a
safer guide than the contemporary writings of men who deliberately
discarded or arbitrarily modified tradition in favour
of the results of their own personal speculations. First then the
peasants of modern Greece must furnish our clue to the popular
beliefs of antiquity; afterwards we may profitably consider the
use and handling of those beliefs in ancient literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span></p>

<p>To this end I shall examine first and necessarily at some
length a certain abnormal condition of the dead about which very
definite ideas are everywhere held; for the abhorrence and dread
with which the abnormal state is regarded will be an accurate
measure of the eagerness with which the opposite and normal
state is desired; and further in this desire to promote and to
secure the normal condition of the departed will be found the
motive of various funeral-customs.</p>

<p>This abnormal condition of the dead is a kind of vampirism.
It is believed that under certain conditions a dead body is withheld
from the normal process of corruption, is re-animated, and
revisits the scenes of its former life, sometimes in a harmless or
even kindly mood, but far more often bent on mischief and on
murder. The superstition as it now stands is by no means wholly
Greek or wholly popular. Two extraneous influences, the one
Slavonic and the other ecclesiastical, have considerably modified
it. But in the present section I shall confine myself to describing
the appearance, nature, habits, and proper treatment of
the Greek vampire as he is now conceived; the work of analysing
the superstition and of separating the pure Hellenic metal from
the extraneous alloys with which in its now current form it is
contaminated will occupy the next section; and the two which
follow will be devoted to showing that the native residue of superstition
was in fact well known to the ancient Greeks and was
utilised to no small extent in their literature.</p>

<p>The best accounts of this superstition and of the savage
practices to which it led are furnished by writers of the seventeenth
century. At the present day, though the superstition is
far from extinction, the more violent outbreaks of it are comparatively
rare; and, although stories dealing with it may
frequently be heard, it might perhaps be difficult to piece together
any complete and coherent account of the Greek vampire
without a previous knowledge obtained from writers of two or
three centuries ago. In such stories as I myself have heard
I have found nothing new, and have often missed something with
which older narratives had made me familiar. In the seventeenth
century some parts of Greece would seem to have been infested
by these vampires. The island of Santorini (the ancient Thera)
acquired so enduring a notoriety in this respect, that even at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
present day ‘to send vampires to Santorini<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>’ is a proverbial
expression synonymous with ‘owls to Athens’ or ‘coals to Newcastle’;
and the inhabitants of the island enjoyed so wide a reputation
as experts in dealing with them, that two stories recently
published<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>, one from Myconos and the other from Sphakiá in Crete,
actually end with the despatch of a vampire’s body to Santorini
for effective treatment there. The justice of this reputation will
shortly appear; for one of the best accounts of the superstition
was written by a Jesuit residing in the island, to whom the
resurrection of these vampires seemed an unquestionable, if
also inexplicable, phenomenon of by no means rare occurrence.
Nowadays cases of suspected vampirism are much less common,
and I can count myself very fortunate to have once witnessed the
sequel of such a case. But of that more anon.</p>

<p>The most common form of the Greek name for this species of
vampire is <span class="greek">βρυκόλακας</span><a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>, and in order to avoid on the one hand
continual qualification of the word ‘vampire’ (which I have used
hitherto as the nearest though not exact equivalent) and on the
other hand confusion of the Greek with the Slavonic species from
which in certain traits it differs, I prefer henceforth to adopt a
transliteration of the Greek word, and, save where I have occasion
to speak of the purely Slavonic form of vampire, to employ the
name <i>vrykólakas</i> (plural <i>vrykólakes</i><a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>).</p>

<p>The first of those writers of the seventeenth century whose
accounts deserve attention is one to whose treatise on various
Greek superstitions reference has already frequently been made,
Leo Allatius. ‘The <i>vrykolakas</i>,’ he writes<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>, ‘is the body of a
man of evil and immoral life&mdash;very often of one who has been
excommunicated by his bishop. Such bodies do not like those of
other dead men suffer decomposition after burial nor turn to dust,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
but having, as it appears, a skin of extreme toughness become
swollen and distended all over, so that the joints can scarcely be
bent; the skin becomes stretched like the parchment of a drum,
and when struck gives out the same sound; from this circumstance
the <i>vrykolakas</i> has received the name <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span> (“drumlike”).’
Into such a body, he continues, the devil enters, and
issuing from the tomb goes about, chiefly at night, knocking
at doors and calling one of the household. If such an one
answer, he dies next day; but a <i>vrykolakas</i> never calls twice,
and so the inhabitants of Chios (whence Allatius’ observations
and information were chiefly derived) secure themselves by always
waiting for a second call at night before replying. ‘This monster
is said to be so destructive to men, that appearing actually in the
daytime, even at noon&mdash;and that not only in houses but in fields
and highroads and enclosed vineyards&mdash;it advances upon them as
they walk along, and by its mere aspect without either speech or
touch kills them.’ Hence, when sudden deaths occur without
other assignable cause, they open the tombs and often find such a
body. Thereupon ‘it is taken out of the grave, the priests recite
prayers, and it is thrown on to a burning pyre; before the supplications
are finished the joints of the body gradually fall apart;
and all the remains are burnt to ashes....’ ‘This belief,’ he
pursues, ‘is not of fresh and recent growth in Greece; in ancient
and modern times alike men of piety who have received the
confessions of Christians have tried to root it out of the popular
mind.’</p>

<p>As evidence of this statement he adduces a <i>nomocanon</i>, or
ordinance of the Greek Church, of uncertain authorship:</p>

<p>‘Concerning a dead man, if such be found whole and incorrupt,
the which they call <i>vrykolakas</i>.</p>

<p>‘It is impossible that a dead man become a <i>vrykolakas</i>, save it
be that the Devil, wishing to delude some that they may do
things unmeet and incur the wrath of God, maketh these portents,
and oft-times at night causeth men to imagine that the dead man
whom they knew before<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> cometh and speaketh with them, and
in their dreams too they see visions. Other times they see him
in the road, walking or standing still, and, more than this, he
even throttles men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span></p>
<p>‘Then there is a commotion and they run to the grave and dig
to see the remains of the man ... and the dead man&mdash;one who has
long been dead and buried&mdash;appears to them to have flesh and
blood and nails and hair ... and they collect wood and set fire to
it and burn the body and do away with it altogether....’</p>

<p>Then, after denying the reality of such things, which exist in
imagination (<span class="greek">κατὰ φαντασίαν</span>) only, the <i>nomocanon</i> with some
inconsistency continues: ‘But know that when such remains be
found, the which, as we have said, is a work of the Devil, ye must
summon the priests to chant an invocation of the Mother of
God, ... and to perform memorial services for the dead with funeral-meats<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>.’</p>

<p>Allatius then leaving the <i>nomocanon</i> pronounces his own
views. ‘It is the height of folly to deny altogether that such
bodies are sometimes found in the graves incorrupt, and that
by use of them the Devil, if God permit him, devises horrible
plans to the hurt of the human race.’ He therefore advocates
the burning of them, always accompanied by prayers.</p>

<p>To the fact of non-decomposition he cites several witnesses&mdash;among
them Crusius<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> who narrates the case of a Greek’s body
being found by Turks in this condition after the man had been
two years dead and being burnt by them. Moreover Allatius
himself claims to have been an eye-witness of such a scene when
he was at school in Chios. A tomb having for some reason been
opened at the church of St Antony, ‘on the top of the bones of
other men there was found lying a corpse perfectly whole; it
was unusually tall of stature; clothes it had none, time or
moisture having caused them to perish; the skin was distended,
hard, and livid, and so swollen everywhere, that the body had no
flat surfaces but was round like a full sack<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>. The face was
covered with hair dark and curly; on the head there was little
hair, as also on the rest of the body, which appeared smooth all
over; the arms by reason of the swelling of the corpse were
stretched out on each side like the arms of a cross; the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
were open, the eyelids closed, the mouth gaping, and the teeth
white.’ How the body was finally treated or disposed of is not
related.</p>

<p>The next writer whose testimony deserves notice and respect
is Father François Richard, a Jesuit priest of the island of
Santorini, to whose work on that island reference has above been
made<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>. Agreeing with Allatius in his description of the appearance
of <i>vrykolakes</i>, he adds thereto many instances of their unpleasantly
active habits. His whole narrative bears the stamp of good faith,
but is too long to translate in full; and I must therefore content
myself with a <i>précis</i> of it, indicating by inverted commas such
phrases and sentences as are literally rendered.</p>

<p>The Devil, he says<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>, works by means of dead bodies as well as
by living sorcerers. ‘These bodies he animates and preserves for a
long time in their entirety; he appears with the face of the dead,
traversing now the streets and anon the open country; he enters
men’s houses, leaving some horror-stricken, others deprived of
speech, and others again lifeless; here he inflicts violence, there
loss, and everywhere terror.’ At first I believed these apparitions
to be merely the souls of the dead returning to ask help
to escape the sooner from Purgatory; but such souls never
commit such excesses&mdash;assault, destruction of property, death,
and so forth. It is clearly then a form of diabolical possession;
for indeed the priests with the bishop’s permission employ forms
of exorcism. They assemble on Saturday (the only day on which
<i>vrykolakes</i> rest in the grave and cannot stir abroad) and exhume
the body which is suspected. ‘And when they find it whole, fresh,
and full of blood, they take it as certain that it was serving as
an instrument of the Devil.’ They accordingly continue their
exorcisms until with the departure of the Devil the body begins
to decompose and gradually to lose ‘its colour and its <i>embonpoint</i>,
and is left a noisome and ghastly lump.’ So rapid was the decomposition
in the case of a Greek priest’s daughter, Caliste by
name, that no one could remain in the church, and the body was
hastily re-interred; from that time she ceased to appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span></p>

<p>When exorcisms fail, they tear the heart out, cut it to pieces,
and then burn the whole body to ashes.</p>

<p>At Stampalia (Astypalaea), he proceeds, a short time before my
arrival (about the middle of the seventeenth century) five bodies
were so treated, those of three married men, a Greek monk, and a
girl. In Nio (Ios) a woman who was confessing to me affirmed
that she had seen her husband again fifty days after burial, though
already his grave had been once changed and the ordinary rites
performed to lay him. He began however again to torment the
people, killing actually some four or five; so his body was
exhumed for the second time and was publicly burnt. Only
two years ago they burnt two bodies in the island of Siphanto
for the same reason; ‘and rarely does a year pass in which people
do not speak with dread of these false resuscitations.’ In Santorini
a shoemaker named Alexander living at Pyrgos became a
<i>vrykolakas</i>; he used to frequent his house, mend his children’s shoes,
draw water at the reservoir, and cut wood for the use of his
family; but the people became frightened, exhumed him, and
burned him, and he was seen no more.... In Amorgos these
<i>vrykolakes</i> have been seen not only at night but in open day,
five or six together in a field, feeding apparently on green beans.</p>

<p>I heard, continues the holy father, from the Abbé of the
famous monastery of Amorgos, that a certain merchant of Patmos,
having gone abroad on business, died. His widow sent a boat to
bring his body home. Now it so happened that one of the sailors
sat down by accident upon the coffin and to his horror felt the
body move. They opened the coffin therefore and found the body
intact. Their fears being thus confirmed, they nailed up the coffin
again and handed it over to the widow without a word and it was
buried. But soon the dead man began to appear at night in the
houses, violent and turbulent to such a degree that more than
fifteen persons died of fright or of injuries inflicted by it. The
exorcisms of priests and monks proved useless, and they thought
best to send back the body whence it had been brought. The
sailors however unshipped it at the first desert island<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> and burnt
it there, after which it was seen no more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span></p>
<p>The Abbé considered this possession by the devil to be a proof
of the truth of the Greek persuasion, alleging that no Mohammedan
or Roman Catholic ever became a <i>vrykolakas</i><a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>. This however
is not strictly accurate, for in Santorini a Roman priest,
who had apostatized and turned Mohammedan and who for his
many crimes was finally hanged, appeared after death and was
only disposed of by burning.</p>

<p>Another case was that of Iannetis Anapliotis of the same island,
an usurer who about a year before his death repented of his misdeeds
and made what amends he could; he also left his wife an
order to pay anything else justly reclaimed from him. She however
though giving much in charity did not pay his debts. It was
just six weeks after his death when she refused to satisfy some
just claim for repayment, and immediately he began to appear
in the streets and to molest above all his own wife and relatives.
Also he woke up priests early in the morning, telling them it was
time for matins, pulled coverlets off people as they slept, shook
their beds, left the taps of wine-barrels running, and so on. One
woman was so frightened in broad day-light as to lose the power
of speech for three days, and another whose bed he shook suffered
a miscarriage. Then at length his name was published&mdash;for as
a man of some position he had till then been spared. Exorcism
was tried in vain by the Greek priests. Then by my advice the
widow paid off all her husband’s debts and made due restitution.
Also she had the body exhumed and exorcised a second time. On
this occasion I saw it, but it did not look like a real <i>vrykolakas</i>;
for, though the hands were whole and parchment-like, the head
and the entrails were to some extent decomposed. At the end of
the ceremony of exorcism the priests hacked the body to pieces
and buried it in a new grave. From this time the <i>vrykolakas</i>
never re-appeared, but this was due, in my opinion, to the restitution
made, not to the treatment of the body.</p>

<p>There are in Greek cemeteries dead bodies of another kind
which after fifteen or sixteen years&mdash;sometimes even twenty or
thirty&mdash;are found inflated like balloons, and when they are thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
on the ground or rolled along, sound like drums; for this reason
they have the name <span class="greek">ντουπί</span><a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> (drum).... The common opinion of
the Greeks is that this inflation is a sure sign that the man had
suffered excommunication; and indeed Greek priests and bishops
add always to the formula of excommunication the curse, <span class="greek">καὶ
μετὰ τὸν θάνατον ἄλυτος καὶ ἀπαράλυτος</span>, ‘and after death to
remain indissoluble<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>.’</p>

<p>In a manuscript from the Church of St Sophia at Thessalonica,
he continues, I found the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="greek">Ὁποῖος ἔχει ἐντολὴν ἢ κατάραν, κρατοῦσι μόνον τὰ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ σώματός
του.</span></p>

<p><span class="greek">Ἐκεῖνος ὁποῦ ἔχει ἀνάθεμα, φαίνεται κιτρινὸς καὶ ζαρωμένα τὰ δακτύλιά του.</span></p>

<p><span class="greek">Ἐκεῖνος ὁποῦ φαίνεται ἀσπρὸς</span><a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> (<i>sic</i>), <span class="greek">εἶναι ἀφωρισμένος παρὰ τῶν θείων
νόμων.</span></p>

<p><span class="greek">Ἐκεῖνος ὁποῦ φαίνεται μαῦρος, εἶναι ἀφωρισμένος ὑπὸ ἀρχιερέως.</span></p>

<p>‘He who has left a command of his parents unfulfilled or is under their
curse has only the front portions of his body preserved.</p>

<p>‘He who is under an anathema looks yellow and his fingers are wrinkled.</p>

<p>‘He who looks white has been excommunicated by divine laws.</p>

<p>‘He who looks black has been excommunicated by a bishop.’</p>
</div>

<p>From this account it is manifest that Father Richard, with the
experience acquired by residence in Santorini, drew a distinction
not known to Leo Allatius between two classes of dead persons.
Those, who though not subject to the natural law of decomposition
lay quiescent in their graves, were merely <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖοι</span> or ‘drum-like’;
while <i>vrykolakes</i> proper were addicted also to periodical
resurrection. And the extract with which he concludes his
description shows that the authorities of the rival Church pretended
to powers of even more subtle discrimination between
different species of incorrupt corpses. The importance of Father
Richard’s distinction will appear later; there was originally a
difference in the usage of the two words, although not precisely
the difference which he makes; but by the middle of the seventeenth
century popular speech rarely discriminated between them.
To the common-folk, whose views Leo Allatius fairly presents, any
body which was withheld from decomposition for any cause was at
least a potential <i>vrykolakas</i>, even if its power of resurrection was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
not known to have been exerted and no act of violence had been
traced to it.</p>

<p>For further attestation of the prevalence and the violence
of this superstition it would be easy to quote many graphic
accounts by other writers, such as Robert Sauger<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>, another Jesuit
of Santorini, or the traveller Tournefort<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>. But it will suffice to call
as witness Paul Lucas, whose observations concern a part of the
Greek world remote enough from either Chios or Santorini, the
island of Corfu. ‘Some persons,’ he says, ‘who seem possessed of
sound good sense speak of a curious thing which often happens in
this place, as also in the island of Santorini. According to their
account dead persons return and show themselves in open day,
going even into the houses and inspiring great terror in those who
see them. In consequence of this, whenever one of these apparitions
is seen, the people go at once to the cemetery to exhume the
corpse, which is then cut in pieces and finally is burnt by sentence
of the Governors and Magistrates. This done, these quasi-dead
return no more. Monsieur Angelo Edme, Warden and Governor
of the island, assured me that he himself had pronounced a
sentence of this kind in a case where upwards of fifty reasonable
persons were found to testify to the occurrence<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>.’</p>

<p>The superstition, which had so firm a grip upon the Greeks
of two or three centuries ago, has by no means relaxed its
hold at the present day, in spite of the efforts made by the
higher authorities civil and ecclesiastical, native and foreign, to
suppress those savage and gruesome ceremonies to which it
leads. The horrible scenes of old time, when the suspected
body was dragged from its grave and dismembered by a panic-stricken
and desperate mob, when the heart, as sometimes
happened, was torn out and boiled to shreds in vinegar, or when
the ghastly remains were burnt on a public bonfire, have certainly
become rarer. The administrative action of the Venetians
in the Ionian Islands in requiring proof to be furnished of the
<i>vrykolakas’</i> resuscitation, and official sanction to be obtained for
exhuming and burning the body; the more vigorous suppression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
of such acts by the Turks in the Aegean Islands<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> and probably also
on the mainland; the somewhat half-hearted condemnation of the
superstition by the Greek Church, which, as we shall see later,
maintained the belief in the non-decomposition of excommunicated
persons and notorious sinners, hesitated between denying
and explaining the further notion that such persons were liable to
re-animation, but certainly endeavoured to repress or to mitigate
the atrocities to which that notion led; and at the present day
the forces of law and order as represented on the one hand by
the police and on the other by modern education, the chief fruit
of which is a desire to appear ‘civilised’ in the eyes of Europe;
all these influences combined have certainly succeeded in reducing
the proportions of the superstition and curtailing the excesses
consequent upon it. Thus in some places the old practice of
burning corpses which fail to decompose within the normal period&mdash;and
it must be remembered that exhumation after three years’
burial is an established rite of the Church in Greece&mdash;has been
definitely superseded by milder expedients. In Scyros the body
is carried round to forty churches in turn and is then re-interred,
while in parts of Crete, in Cythnos<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>, and, I believe, in some other
Aegean Islands the custom is to transfer the body to a grave in
some uninhabited islet, whence its return is barred by the intervening
salt water.</p>

<p>None the less the superstition itself still holds a firm place
among the traditional beliefs of modern Greece. Witness the
following account of it from a history<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> of the district of Sphakiá
in Crete written by the head of a monastery there and published
in 1888:</p>

<p>‘It is popularly believed that most of the dead, those who
have lived bad lives or who have been excommunicated by some
priest (or, worse still, by seven priests together, <span class="greek">τὸ ἑπταπάπαδον</span><a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>)
become <i>vrykolakes</i><a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>; that is to say, after the separation
of the soul from the body there enters into the latter an evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
spirit, which takes the place of the soul and assumes the shape
of the dead man and so is transformed into a <i>vrykolakas</i> or
man-demon.</p>

<p>‘In this guise it keeps the body as its dwelling-place and
preserves it from corruption, and it runs swift as lightning
wherever it lists, and causes men great alarms at night and
strikes all with panic. And the trouble is that it does not remain
solitary, but makes everyone, who dies while it is about,
like to itself, so that in a short space of time it gets together a
large and dangerous train of followers. The common practice of
the <i>vrykolakes</i> is to seat themselves upon those who are asleep
and by their enormous weight to cause an agonizing sense of
oppression. There is great danger that the sufferer in such cases
may expire, and himself too be turned into a <i>vrykolakas</i>, if there
be not someone at hand who perceives his torment and fires off a
gun, thereby putting the blood-thirsty monster to flight; for
fortunately it is afraid of the report of fire-arms and retreats
without effecting its purpose. Not a few such scenes we have
witnessed with our own eyes.</p>

<p>‘This monster, as time goes on, becomes more and more
audacious and blood-thirsty, so that it is able completely to
devastate whole villages. On this account all possible haste is
made to annihilate the first which appears before it enter upon
its second period of forty days<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>, because by that time it becomes a
merciless and invincible dealer of death. To this end the villagers
call in priests who profess to know how to annihilate the monster&mdash;for
a consideration. These impostors proceed after service to
the tomb, and if the monster be not found there&mdash;for it goes to
and fro molesting men&mdash;they summon it in authoritative tones to
enter its dwelling-place; and, as soon as it is come, it is imprisoned
there by virtue of some prayer and subsequently breaks up.
With its disruption all those who have been turned into <i>vrykolakes</i>
by it, wherever they may be, suffer the same lot as their
leader.</p>

<p>‘This absurd superstition is rife and vigorous throughout
Crete and especially in the mountainous and secluded parts of
the island.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span></p>
<p>So too another well-informed Greek writer, who has published
a series of monographs upon the Cyclades, says in one of them<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>:</p>

<p>‘The ignorant peasant of Andros believes to this day that
the corpse can rise again and do him hurt; and is not this belief
in <i>vrykolakes</i> general throughout Greece?’</p>

<p>To that question I might without hesitation answer ‘yes,’
even on the grounds of my own experience only; for the places in
which I have heard <i>vrykolakes</i> mentioned, not merely in popular
stories<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> such as are told everywhere, but with a very present and
real sense of dread, include some villages on the west slopes of
Mount Pelion, the village of Leonidi on the east coast of the
Peloponnese, Andros, Tenos, Santorini, and Cephalonia.</p>

<p>The wide range and general prevalence of the superstition in
modern times being thus established, it remains only to record a
few recent cases in which the peasants, in defiance of law and
order, have gone the length of exhuming and burning the
suspected body.</p>

<p>Theodore Bent<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> states that a few months before his visit
to Andros (somewhat over twenty years ago) the grave of a
suspected <i>vrykolakas</i> was opened by a priest and the body taken
out, cut into shreds, and burnt. In January of 1895 at Mantoúde
in Euboea a woman was believed to have turned <i>vrykolakas</i> and
to have caused many deaths, and the peasants resolved to exhume
and burn her&mdash;but it is not stated whether the resolve was
actually carried out<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>. In 1899, when I was in Santorini, I was
told that two or three years previously the inhabitants of Therasia
had burnt a <i>vrykolakas</i>, and when I visited that island the
incident was not denied but the responsibility for it was laid
upon the people of Santorini. In 1902 there was a similar case of
burning at Gourzoúmisa near Patras<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>. These are certain and well-attested
instances of the continuance of the practice, and, regard
being had to the secrecy which such breaches of the law
necessarily demand, it is not unreasonable to suppose that even
now a year seldom passes in which some village of Greece does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
not disembarrass itself of a <i>vrykolakas</i> by the traditional means,
cremation<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the causes by which a man is predisposed to become a
<i>vrykolakas</i> some mention has already been made in the passages
which have been cited from various writers above; but before
I conclude this account of the superstition as it now is and has
been since the seventeenth century, and proceed to analyse its
composite nature, it may be convenient to give a complete list of
such causes. The majority of these are recognised all over Greece
and are familiar to every student of modern Greek folklore, and
I shall not therefore burden this chapter with references to
previous writers whose observations tally exactly with my own;
for rarer and more local beliefs I shall of course quote my
authority.</p>

<p>The classes of persons who are most liable to become <i>vrykolakes</i>
are:</p>

<p>(1) Those who do not receive the full and due rites of burial.</p>

<p>(2) Those who meet with any sudden or violent death
(including suicides), or, in Maina<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>, where the <i>vendetta</i> is still in
vogue, those who having been murdered remain unavenged.</p>

<p>(3) Children conceived or born on one of the great Church-festivals<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>,
and children stillborn<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>.</p>

<p>(4) Those who die under a curse, especially the curse of a
parent, or one self-invoked, as in the case of a man who, in perjuring
himself, calls down on his own head all manner of damnation if
what he says be false.</p>

<p>(5) Those who die under the ban of the Church, that is to
say, excommunicate.</p>

<p>(6) Those who die unbaptised or apostate<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>.</p>

<p>(7) Men of evil and immoral life in general, more particularly
if they have dealt in the blacker kinds of sorcery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span></p>

<p>(8) Those who have eaten the flesh of a sheep which was
killed by a wolf<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>.</p>

<p>(9) Those over whose dead bodies a cat or other animal has
passed<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>provenance</i> and the significance of these various beliefs
concerning the causes of vampirism will be discussed in the next
section.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 2. <span class="smcap">The Composition of the Superstition.
Slavonic, Ecclesiastical, and Hellenic Contributions.</span></h3>

</div>

<p><i>Vrykolakes</i> are not ghosts. Such is the first observation which
I am compelled to make and which the reader of the last chapter
might well consider superfluous. But so many Greek writers,
and with them even Bernhard Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>, have fallen into the error
of comparing ancient ghost-stories with modern tales about
<i>vrykolakes</i>, without apparently recognising the essential and
fundamental difference between them, that some insistence upon
the point is necessary. That a definite and close relation does
indeed subsist between the ancient belief in wandering spirits
and the modern belief in wandering corpses, I readily admit, and
with that relation I shall deal later; but the issue before us can
only be kept clear by remembering that <i>vrykolakes</i> are not ghosts.
There is absolute unanimity among the Greek peasants in their
belief that the corpse itself is the <i>vrykolakas</i>, and even the work
of re-animating the corpse is generally credited not to the soul
which formerly inhabited it, but to the Devil. Thus it appears
that whereas most peoples believe to some extent in the return of
the ghosts or spirits of the dead, the Greeks fear rather the
return of their bodies. If then we can determine what part, if
any, of this superstition is genuinely Hellenic, we shall have gained
a step in our knowledge of the ideas popularly held in ancient
Greece concerning the condition and the relations of soul and
body after death.</p>

<p>The view which I take is briefly this, that though Slavonic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
influence is very conspicuous in the modern superstition as
I have described it, yet the whole superstition has not been
transplanted root and branch from Slavonic to Greek soil, but
the growth, as we now see it and as the writers of the seventeenth
century saw it, is the result of the grafting of Slavonic branches
upon an Hellenic stock; and further, that before that process
began the old pagan Greek element in the superstition had been
modified in certain respects by ecclesiastical influence. This
is the view which I propose to develop in this section; and my
method will be to work back from the modern superstition, removing
first the Slavonic and then the ecclesiastical elements in it,
and so leaving a residue of purely Hellenic belief.</p>

<p>To Slavonic influence is due first of all the actual word <i>vrykolakas</i>,
the derivation of which need not long detain us. Patriotic
attempts have indeed been made by Greeks to deny its Slavonic
origin, the most plausible being that of Coraës<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>, who selecting
the local form <span class="greek">βορβόλακας</span> sought to identify it with a supposed
ancient form <span class="greek">μορμόλυξ</span> (= <span class="greek">μορμολύκη, μορμολυκεῖον</span>), a ‘bugbear’
or ‘hobgoblin’ of some kind. But there need be no hesitation in
pronouncing this suggestion wrong and in asserting the identity
of the modern Greek word with a word which runs through all
the Slavonic languages. This word is in form a compound
of which the first half means ‘wolf’ and the second has been less
certainly identified with <i>dlaka</i>, the ‘hair’ of a cow or horse.
But, however the meaning of the compound has been obtained, it
is, in the actual usage of all Slavonic languages save one, the exact
equivalent of our ‘were-wolf<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>.’ That one exception is the Serbian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
language in which it is said to bear rather the sense of ‘vampire<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>.’
If this is true, the reason for the transition of meaning lies
probably in the belief current among the Slavonic peoples in
general that a man who has been a were-wolf in his lifetime becomes
a vampire after death<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>. Yet in general there is no confusion
of nomenclature. Although the depredations of the were-wolf
and of the vampire are similar in character, the line of demarcation
between the living and the dead is kept clear, and
the great mass of the Slavonic peoples apply only to the living
that word from which the Greek <i>vrykolakas</i> comes, and to the
dead the word which we have borrowed in the form ‘vampire<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>.’</p>

<p>Now among the Greeks the latter word is almost unknown;
in parts of Macedonia indeed where the Greek population lives
in constant touch with Slavonic peoples, a form <span class="greek">βάμπυρας</span> or
<span class="greek">βόμπυρας</span> has been adopted and is used as a synonym of <i>vrykolakas</i>
in its ordinary Greek sense<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>; but in Greece proper and in
the Greek islands the word ‘vampire’ is, so far as I can discover,
absolutely non-existent, and it is <i>vrykolakas</i> which ordinarily
denotes the resuscitated corpse. In discriminating therefore
between the Slavonic and the Greek elements in the modern
Greek superstition it is of some importance to determine in
which sense the Greeks originally borrowed the word <i>vrykolakas</i>
which at the present day they in general employ in a different
sense from that which both etymology and general Slavonic usage
accord to it. Was it originally borrowed in the sense of ‘were-wolf’
or in the sense of ‘vampire’?</p>

<p>Among Slavonic peoples the only one said to have transferred
the word <i>vrykolakas</i> from its original meaning to that of
‘vampire’ is the Serbian; and the Greeks therefore, in order to
have borrowed the word in that sense, would have had to borrow
direct from the Serbian language. But linguistic evidence renders
that hypothesis untenable. All the many Greek dialectic forms
of the word <i>vrykolakas</i> concur in showing a liquid (<span class="greek">ρ</span> or <span class="greek">λ</span>) in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
first syllable; while Serbian is among the two or three Slavonic
languages which have discarded that liquid. It follows therefore
that the Greeks borrowed the word from some Slavonic language
other than Serbian, and consequently from some language which
used and still uses that word in the sense of ‘were-wolf.’</p>

<p>Further, there is evidence that in the Greek language itself the
word <i>vrykolakas</i> does even now locally and occasionally bear its
original significance. This usage indeed is flatly denied by
Bernhard Schmidt, who, having accurately distinguished the
were-wolf and the vampire, states that ‘the modern Greek <i>vrykolakas</i>
answers only to the latter<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>.’ This pronouncement however
was made in the face of two strong pieces of independent evidence
to the contrary, which Schmidt notices and dismisses in a footnote<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>.
The first witness is Hanush<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a>, who was plainly told by a
Greek of Mytilene that there were two kinds of <i>vrykolakes</i>, the one
kind being men already dead, and the other still living men who
were subject to a kind of somnambulism and were seen abroad
particularly on moonlight nights. The other authority is Cyprien
Robert<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>, who describes the <i>vrykolakes</i> of Thessaly and Epirus
thus: ‘These are living men mastered by a kind of somnambulism,
who seized by a thirst for blood go forth at night from
their shepherd’s-huts, and scour the country biting and tearing all
that they meet both man and beast.’</p>

<p>To these two pieces of testimony&mdash;strong enough, it might be
thought, in their mutual agreement to merit more than passing
notice and arbitrary rejection&mdash;I can add confirmation of more
recent date. In Cyprus, during excavations carried out in the
spring of 1899 under the auspices of the British Museum, the
directors of the enterprise heard from their workmen several
stories dealing with the detection of a <i>vrykolakas</i>. The outline
of these stories (to which Tenos furnishes many parallels<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>, though
in these latter I have not found the word <i>vrykolakas</i> employed) is
as follows. The inhabitants of a particular village, having suffered
from various nocturnal depredations, determine to keep watch at
night for the marauder. Having duly armed themselves they
maintain a strict vigil, and are rewarded by seeing a <i>vrykolakas</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
Thereupon one of them with gun or sword succeeds in inflicting
a wound upon the monster, which however for the nonce escapes.
But the next day a man of the village, who had not been among
the watchers of the night, is observed to bear a wound exactly
corresponding with that which the assailant of the <i>vrykolakas</i> had
dealt; and being taxed with it the man confesses himself to be a
<i>vrykolakas.</i></p>

<p>Similarly on the borders of Aetolia and Acarnania, in the
neighbourhood of Agrinion, I myself ascertained that the word
<i>vrykolakas</i> was occasionally applied to living persons in the sense
of were-wolf, although there as elsewhere it more commonly
denotes a resuscitated corpse. Lycanthropy, as has been observed
in a previous chapter<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>, is in Greece often imputed to children.
In the district mentioned this is conspicuously the case. If
one or more children in a family die without evident cause, the
mother will often regard the smallest or weakliest of the survivors&mdash;more
especially one in any way deformed or demented&mdash;as
guilty of the brothers’ or sisters’ deaths, and the suspect is
called a <i>vrykolakas</i>. <span class="greek">Εἶσαι βρυκόλακας καὶ ’φάγες τὸν ἀδερφό
σου</span>, ‘you are a <i>vrykolakas</i> and have devoured your brother,’ is
the charge hurled at the helpless infant, and ill-treatment to
match is meted out in the hope of deterring it from its bloodthirsty
ways.</p>

<p>In effect from four widely separated parts of the Greek world&mdash;Mytilene,
Cyprus, the neighbourhood of Agrinion, and the
district of Thessaly and Epirus&mdash;comes one and the same statement,
that to the word <i>vrykolakas</i> is still, or has recently been,
attached its etymologically correct meaning ‘were-wolf’; and, since
these isolated local usages cannot be explained otherwise than
as survivals of an usage which was once general, they constitute
a second proof that the Greeks originally adopted the word in
the sense in which the vast majority of the Slavonic races continue
down to this day to employ it.</p>

<p>But while it is thus certain that the Greeks first learnt and
acquired the word <i>vrykolakas</i> in the sense of ‘were-wolf,’ it is
equally certain that the main characteristics of the monster to
which that name is now applied are those of the Slavonic ‘vampire.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
The appearance and the habits of the re-animated corpse according
to Slavonic superstition differ hardly at all from those described
in the last chapter. Indeed the question is not so much
whether the Greeks are indebted to the Slavs in respect of this
belief, as what is the extent of their indebtedness. Is the whole
superstition a foreign importation, or is it only partly alien and
partly native?</p>

<p>The former alternative is rendered improbable in the first place
by the fact that the Greeks have not adopted the word ‘vampire.’
If the whole idea of dead men remaining under certain conditions
incorrupt and emerging from their graves to work havoc among
living men had been first communicated to them by the Slavs,
they must almost inevitably have borrowed the name by which
the Slavs described those men. But since in fact they did not
adopt the Slavonic name ‘vampire,’ it is probable that they
already possessed in their own language some word adequate
to express that idea, and therefore possessed also some native
superstition concerning resuscitation of the dead which Slavonic
influence merely modified.</p>

<p>Further, there is positive evidence that such a word or words
existed; for there have been, and still are, dialects which employ
a word of Greek formation in preference not merely to the word
‘vampire,’ which seems to be unknown in Greece proper, but even
to the misapplied Slavonic word <i>vrykolakas</i>. Thus Leo Allatius
was familiar with the word <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span>, ‘drum-like,’ but whether
in his day it belonged especially to his native island Chios<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> or
was still in general usage, he does not record. At the present
day it survives only, so far as I know, in Cythnos, where also
<span class="greek">ἄλυτος</span>, ‘incorrupt,’ is used as another synonym<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>. From Cythera
are reported three names, <span class="greek">ἀνάρραχο</span>, <span class="greek">λάμπασμα</span>, and <span class="greek">λάμπαστρο</span><a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>,
evidently Greek in formation but to me, I must confess, unintelligible.
In Cyprus (where, as we have seen, the word <i>vrykolakas</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
may still bear its old sense ‘were-wolf’) the <i>revenant</i> is named
<span class="greek">σαρκωμένος</span><a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>, because his swollen appearance suggests that he has
‘put on flesh,’ or more rarely <span class="greek">στοιχειωμένος</span><a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>, perhaps with the
idea that he has become the ‘genius’ (<span class="greek">στοιχειό</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> of some particular
locality. Again, from the village of Pyrgos in Tenos is
reported the word <span class="greek">ἀναικαθούμενος</span><a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> meaning apparently one who
‘sits up’ in his grave. Finally, in Crete the name popularly employed
is <span class="greek">καταχανᾶς</span><a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>, the origin of which is not certain. Bernhard
Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>, following Koraës<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>, derives it from <span class="greek">κατὰ</span> and <span class="greek">χάνω</span>
(= ancient Greek <span class="greek">χαόω</span>), ‘lose,’ ‘destroy,’ and would have it mean
accordingly ‘destroyer.’ I would suggest that derivation from
<span class="greek">κατὰ</span> and the root <span class="greek">χαν-</span>, ‘gape,’ ‘yawn,’ is at least equally probable,
inasmuch as other local names such as <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span>, ‘drumlike,’
and <span class="greek">σαρκωμένος</span>, ‘fleshy,’ have reference to the monster’s personal
appearance, and the ‘gaper’ in like manner would be a name
eminently suitable to a creature among whose features are numbered
by Leo Allatius ‘a gaping mouth and gleaming teeth<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>.’
The same name was some forty years ago<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>, and probably still is,
used in Rhodes, and in a Rhodian poem of the fifteenth century
occurs both in its literal sense and as a term of abuse<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>. This
secondary usage however is in no way a proof that the word meant
originally ‘destroyer’ rather than ‘gaper’; for by the fifteenth
century there can be little doubt that the <i>revenant</i> was everywhere
an object of horror, and therefore his name, whatever it
originally meant, furnished a convenient term of vituperation.
But one thing at least is clear, that <span class="greek">καταχανᾶς</span>, whichever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
interpretation of it be right, is certainly a word of Greek origin
no less than the others which I have enumerated.</p>

<p>Now all these dialectic Greek names are found, it will have
been observed, only in certain of the Greek islands, while on the
mainland <i>vrykolakas</i> has come to be universally employed. But
it was the mainland which was particularly exposed to Slavonic
immigration and influence, while islands like Crete and Cyprus
were practically immune. Hence, while the mainland gradually
adopted a Slavonic word, it was likely enough that some of the
islands should retain their own Greek terms, even though in the
course of their relations with the mainland they became acquainted
also with the new Slavonic word. These insular names
for the <i>vrykolakas</i> may therefore be regarded as survivals from
a pre-Slavonic period, and, though they are now merely dialectic,
it is reasonable to suppose that one or more of them formerly
held a place in the language of mainlanders and islanders alike.
But the existence of such words presupposes the existence of a
belief in some kind of resuscitated beings denoted by them. In
other words, the Greeks when first brought into contact with the
Slavs already possessed a belief in the re-animation and activity of
certain dead persons, which so far resembled the Slavonic belief
in vampirism, that the Slavonic vampire could be adequately
denoted by some Greek word or words already existing and there
was no need to adopt the Slavonic name.</p>

<p>I claim then to have established two important points: first,
that the word <i>vrykolakas</i> was originally borrowed by the Greeks
from the Slavs in the sense of ‘were-wolf,’ though now it is almost
universally employed in the sense of ‘vampire’; secondly, that,
whatever ideas concerning vampires the Greeks may have learnt
from the Slavs, they did not adopt the Slavonic word ‘vampire’
but employed one of those native Greek words, such as <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span>
or <span class="greek">καταχανᾶς</span>, which are still in local usage; whence it follows
that some superstition anent re-animated corpses existed in Greece
before the coming of the Slavs.</p>

<p>These points being established, I am now in a position to
trace the development of the superstition in Greece from the time
of the Slavonic immigrations onward, and to show how it came to
pass that, whereas in the tenth century, let us say, when the
Greeks had had ample time to imbibe Slavonic superstitions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
<i>vrykolakas</i> meant a ‘were-wolf,’ and a ‘vampire’ was denoted by
<span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span> or some other Greek word, nowadays <i>vrykolakas</i>
almost always means a ‘vampire’ and <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span> is well-nigh
obsolete.</p>

<p>The Slavs brought with them into Greece two superstitions, the
one concerning were-wolves and the other concerning vampires.
The old Hellenic belief in lycanthropy was apparently at that
time weak&mdash;confined perhaps to a few districts only&mdash;for the
Greeks borrowed from the invaders their word <i>vrykolakas</i> in the
place of the old <span class="greek">λυκάνθρωπος</span><a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>, by which to express the idea of a
‘were-wolf.’ They also learnt the Slavonic superstition concerning
vampires, but in this case did not borrow the word ‘vampire’ but
expressed the notion adequately by means of one of those words
which now survive only in insular dialects&mdash;adequately, I say, but
not exactly. For&mdash;and here I must anticipate what will be proved
later&mdash;the Greeks denoted by those words a <i>revenant</i> but not a
vampire. They believed in the incorruptibility and the re-animation
of certain classes of dead men, but they did not impute
to these <i>revenants</i> the savagery which is implied by the name
‘vampire.’ The dead who returned from their graves acted, it
was held, as reasonable men, not as ferocious brutes. This did
not of course exclude the idea that a <i>revenant</i> might return to
seek revenge where vengeance was due; he was not necessarily
peaceable; but if he exacted even the life of one who had wronged
him, the act of vengeance was reasonable. To the proof of this,
as I have said, I shall come later on; here I will only point out
that the names which survive in the island-dialects are perfectly
consistent with my view. Of the words <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span>, ‘drumlike,’
<span class="greek">σαρκωμένος</span>, ‘fleshy,’ <span class="greek">στοιχειωμένος</span>, ‘<i>genius</i>,’ <span class="greek">ἀναικαθούμενος</span>, ‘sitting
up’ in the grave, and, if my interpretation is right, <span class="greek">καταχανᾶς</span>,
‘gaper,’ not one suggests any inherent ferocity in the resuscitated
dead.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the Greeks first heard of the Slavonic
‘vampire,’ they naturally regarded it merely as a new and particularly
vicious species of the genus <i>revenant</i>. Their own words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
for the genus implied no idea beyond that of the resuscitation of
the dead, and were therefore no less applicable to the uniformly
ferocious Slavonic variety than to the more reasonable and human
type with which they themselves were familiar. They therefore
did not require the word ‘vampire,’ but were content at first to
comprise all <i>revenants</i>, whatever their character, under one or
other of the existing Greek names.</p>

<p>Subsequently however, it appears, a change took place. The
Slavonic superstition concerning were-wolves included then, we
may suppose, as it includes now<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>, the idea that were-wolves become
after death vampires. The Greeks, who borrowed from the
Slavs the very name of the were-wolf, must therewith have learnt
that these <i>vrykolakes</i> as they then called them were among the
classes of men who were liable to vampirism; and in this particular
case it would surely have seemed natural to them that the
<i>revenant</i> should be conspicuous for ferocity. The conduct of a
reasonable being could not be expected after death from one who
in his lifetime had suffered from lycanthropic mania; or rather,
if there could be any reason in his conduct, the most reasonable
and consistent thing would be for him to turn vampire.</p>

<p>Thus one class of <i>revenants</i> came to be distinguished in the
now composite Greek superstition by its wanton and blood-thirsty
character; and in order to mark this distinction in speech also
the Greeks, it would seem, began to call one who from a were-wolf
had become a genuine vampire by the same name after as before
death, <i>vrykolakas</i>, while to the more reasonable and human
<i>revenants</i> they still applied some such term as <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖοι</span>, ‘drumlike.’</p>

<p>By the seventeenth century the superstition had undergone
a further change, which is reflected in the usage of the word
<span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span>. In proportion as the horror of real <i>vrykolakes</i> had
grown and spread, the very memory of the more innocent kind of
<i>revenants</i> had faded, until the genus <i>revenant</i> was represented only
by the species <i>vrykolakas</i>. The word <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span> was indeed still
known, but Leo Allatius was undoubtedly following the popular
usage of his time when he made it synonymous with <i>vrykolakas</i>;
for those narratives of the seventeenth century from which I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
quoted above make it abundantly clear that the common-folk had
come to suspect all <i>revenants</i> alike of predatory propensities.</p>

<p>This change in popular beliefs placed the Church in an awkward
predicament, and was the cause of a marked divergence
between the popular and the clerical usages of the word <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span>.
It had long been claimed that a sentence of excommunication
was binding upon a man even beyond death and could
arrest the natural process of decomposition; indeed the formula
officially employed ended, as Father Richard of Santorini notes,
with the phrase, ‘and after death to remain indissoluble.’ But
when the fear of real vampires spread over Greece, the priests
would naturally have been unwilling to be held responsible for
the resuscitation of such pests, while they were equally unwilling
to diminish the terrors of excommunication by omitting the final
imprecation. Their only course therefore was to emphasize what
seems indeed to have been always the authorised doctrine of the
Church, that excommunicated persons remained indeed incorrupt
and ‘drum-like,’ but were not, like <i>vrykolakes</i>, subject to diabolical
re-animation. It is Father Richard’s acceptance of this clerical
view which explains why, writing as he did some few years after
Leo Allatius, he distinguished the two words which Leo had treated
as synonymous, making resuscitation the criterion of the <i>vrykolakas</i>
and stating that the ‘drum-like’ body, though withheld
from natural decay, lay quiet in its grave. But the ecclesiastical
doctrine made no impression upon the popular belief; to this very
day the common-folk regard any corpse which is found incorrupt
as a potential <i>vrykolakas</i>, and excommunication is everywhere
numbered among the causes of vampirism.</p>

<p>Thus it has come to pass that any <i>revenants</i> other than the
savage <i>vrykolakes</i> are well-nigh forgotten, and in most districts
their very name is no longer heard. The word <i>vrykolakes</i>, which
first meant were-wolves, came to denote also the vampires into
which were-wolves changed, and gradually, as these vampires
by exciting men’s horror and concentrating on themselves the
people’s attention became the predominant class of <i>revenants</i>,
ousted from the very speech of Greece as a whole the old Greek
names for the more harmless sort, and established itself as the
regular equivalent of <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>Such is my solution of the somewhat complex problem of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
nomenclature; and in presenting it I have incidentally stated my
view that the genuinely Greek element in the modern superstition
is a belief in the incorruptibility and re-appearance of dead
persons under certain special conditions, and that the imported and
now dominant element is the Slavonic belief that the resuscitation
of the dead renders them necessarily predatory vampires. This
I now have to prove.</p>

<p>It is a well-established characteristic of the Slavonic vampire
that his violence is directed first and foremost against his nearest
of kin. The same trait is so pronounced too in the modern Greek
<i>vrykolakas</i> that it has given rise to the proverb, <span class="greek">ὁ βρυκόλακας
ἀρχίζει ἀπὸ τὰ γένειά του</span>, ‘the <i>vrykolakas</i> begins with his own
beard’&mdash;a saying which carries a double meaning, so a peasant
told me. It may be taken literally, inasmuch as the <i>vrykolakas</i>
usually appears bald and beardless; but the words <span class="greek">τὰ γένειά
του</span>, ‘his beard,’ are popularly understood as a substitute, half
jocose and half euphemistic, for <span class="greek">τὴ γενεά του</span>, ‘his family.’ In
other words, this most deadly of pagan pests, like the most lively
of Christian virtues, begins at home.</p>

<p>Such being the acknowledged and even proverbial habits of
the <i>vrykolakas</i>, nothing, it might be supposed, could be more
repugnant and fearful to the near relations of a dead man than
the possibility that he would turn <i>vrykolakas</i> and return straightway
to devour them. The first sufferers from such an eventuality
would be the man’s own kinsfolk, the next his acquaintances and
fellow-villagers, but he himself would appear to be aggressor
rather than sufferer. Nevertheless, in face of this consideration,
there is no more commodious form of curse in popular usage than
the ejaculation of a prayer that the person who has incurred one’s
displeasure may be withheld from corruption after death and
return from his grave. I have heard it extended even to a
recalcitrant mule; but it is also used gravely by parents as an
imprecation of punishment hereafter upon undutiful children.
A few samples of this curse will not be out of place, as showing
at once its frequency and its range<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="greek">Νὰ μήν τον δεχτῇ ἡ γῆς</span>, ‘May the earth not receive him’:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
<span class="greek">νὰ μήν τον φάγῃ τὸ χῶμα</span>, ‘May the ground not consume him’:
<span class="greek">ἡ γῆ νὰ μή σε χωνέψῃ</span><a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>, ‘May the earth not digest thee’: <span class="greek">ἡ
μαύρη γῆ νά σ’ ἀναξεράσῃ</span><a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>, ‘May the black earth spew thee up’:
<span class="greek">νὰ μείνῃς ἄλυ̯ωτος</span>, ‘Mayest thou remain incorrupt’: <span class="greek">νὰ μή σε
λυώσῃ ἡ γῆ</span>, ‘May the earth not loose thee’ (i.e. not let thy body
decompose): <span class="greek">νά σε βγάλῃ τὸ χῶμα</span>, ‘May the ground reject thee’:
<span class="greek">κουτοῦκι νὰ βγῇς</span><a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>, ‘Mayest thou become (after death) like a
log (in solidity)’: <span class="greek">τὸ χῶμα ’ξεράσ’ τόνε</span>, ‘May the ground spew
him out’&mdash;this last phrase being made more terrible by being a
parody, as it were, of the prayer uttered by the mourners at every
Greek funeral <span class="greek">ὁ θεὸς ’χωρέσ’ τόνε</span>, ‘May God forgive him.’ Such
are the popular forms of the curse; and akin to them are the
ecclesiastical imprecations, with which the formula of excommunication
used to end: <span class="greek">καὶ ἔσῃ μετὰ θάνατον ἄλυτος αἰωνίως, ὡς
αἱ πέτραι καὶ τὰ σίδηρα</span><a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>, ‘And after death thou shalt be bound
(i.e. incorrupt) eternally, even as stone and iron’; or, in a shorter
form, <span class="greek">καὶ μετὰ τὸν θάνατον ἄλυτος καὶ ἀπαράλυτος</span><a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>, ‘And after
death bound and indissoluble.’ Here, it will be observed, the
Church spoke only of incorruptibility, but several of the popular
expressions contain explicit mention of resuscitation as well; and
the very forms of the curse which I have quoted show how closely
knit together, how almost identical, are these two notions in the
mind of the peasants. That which the earth will not ‘receive,’
she necessarily ‘rejects’; that which she does not ‘consume’ or
‘digest,’ she necessarily ‘spews up.’ The man whose body does
not decompose is necessarily a <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>Now curses, it must be remembered, among a primitive
people are considered as operative, and not merely expletive; each
bullet of malediction deliberately aimed is expected to find its
billet; each imprecation seriously uttered has a magical power of
fulfilling itself. That this belief is firmly held by the Greek folk is
sufficiently proved by certain quaint solemnities enacted beside the
deathbed. It is a common custom<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> for a dying man to put a
handful of salt into a vessel of water, and when it is dissolved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
sprinkle with the liquid all those who are present, saying, <span class="greek">ὡς
λυ̯ώνει τ’ ἀλάτι, νὰ λυ̯ώσουν ᾑ κατάραις μου</span>, ‘As the salt dissolves,
so may my curses dissolve.’ By this ceremony all persons whom he
has cursed are released from the bonds of an imprecation which
after death he would no longer be able to revoke or annul. Then
in turn the relations and friends formally pronounce their forgiveness
of aught that the dying man has done to their hurt. Thus
pardoning and pardoned the sick man may expect a short and
easy passing; and, if the death-struggle be prolonged, it is taken
as a sign that some one whom he has injured has not forgiven
him. Accordingly the friends and kinsmen, having decided among
themselves who the delinquent must be, send to fetch him, if he
be still living, in order that he too may pronounce his forgiveness
and so smooth the passage of the parting soul. If however he be
dead, a portion of his shroud or of his ashes is brought and
burnt, and the sick man, who needs his forgiveness ere he can die
in peace, is fumigated with the smoke therefrom.</p>

<p>Since then curses in general are regarded by the Greek folk
no less than by other primitive peoples as effective instruments of
wrath which work out their own fulfilment, the particular curses
which we are considering, when they are gravely uttered, do
seriously contemplate the possibility of the person cursed becoming
after death a <i>revenant</i> and are designed to bring about
that future state.</p>

<p>But, if already at the time when such imprecations first became
popular it had been believed that their effect was to render the
corpse, whose decay was arrested and whose resuscitation was
assured, a wanton and blood-thirsty monster, preying first of all
upon his nearest of kin, the question of relationship or no relationship
between the curser and the cursed would necessarily have
been taken into account.</p>

<p>On the one hand, where a man was in no degree akin to the
object of his wrath, he would have welcomed the opportunity of
including his enemy’s whole family in his vengeance by causing
him to return and devour them. For in Greece recrimination is
wholly unsparing, and no man pretending to any elegance or taste
in the matter of abuse could neglect to level his taunts and threats
and curses at least as much against the relatives&mdash;especially the
female relatives&mdash;of his enemy as against the man himself. Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
as the tenderest blessings among the peasants are prayers, not for
him to whom they wish well, but rather for those whom he has
loved and lost, so that the beggar’s thanks are often ‘May God forgive
your father and your mother’ (which, however it may sound, is
not intended otherwise than graciously) or again, prettier still in its
vague genderless plural which no translation can adequately render,
<span class="greek">ὁ θεὸς ’χωρέσ’ τὰ πεθαμμένα σου</span>, ‘May God forgive your dead,’ so
the harshest and bitterest of curses are vented, not upon the man
who has excited them, but upon those who are nearest and dearest
to him. And bitterness in cursing being as much a part of the
Greek character as gentleness in blessing, it is almost inconceivable
that, if any idea of real vampirism had originally been associated
with <i>revenants</i>, the merest novice in malediction could have missed
the opportunity of adding to his imprecations of incorruptibility
and resuscitation a prayer that his enemy might devastate with
horrid carnage the home of those who mourned him. Yet not
one of the curses which I have quoted above suggests any
savagery to be shown by the resuscitated body; not one of them
hints at the blood-thirsty predatory character of the modern
<i>vrykolakas</i>; nay, most significant of all, not one of them contains
the word <i>vrykolakas</i>, nor have I ever heard or found recorded, so
far as I can remember, any form of the curse in which that word
appears<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>. Now this is certainly not due to any difficulty of
language in using the word, for there is a convenient enough
verb formed from it, <span class="greek">βρυκολακιάζω</span>, ‘I turn vampire,’ and <span class="greek">νὰ
βρυκολακιάσης</span>, ‘May you turn vampire,’ should commend itself
as both sonorous and compendious. The reason why all mention
and all thought of the ordinary <i>vrykolakas</i> are lacking in these
curses must rather be that, when they first came into vogue,
<i>revenants</i> were not yet credited with the savage character which
under Slavonic influence they afterwards acquired; and that, when
the word <i>vrykolakas</i> was introduced, the old traditional forms of
curse underwent no modification, but were bandied to and fro by
boys with the same glib uniformity as by their fathers before
them. They had been cast in set forms before the idea of vampirism
had been introduced and when men believed only in reasonable
and usually harmless <i>revenants</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, where the curser was akin to the cursed,
the nearer the tie of blood the more incomprehensible would be
the attitude of one who by an imprecation should recall from the
grave so malignant a thing as the modern <i>vrykolakas</i>, only to fall
himself perhaps the first victim to its blood-thirstiness. If the
phrase ‘May the earth reject thee’ had suggested anything beyond
simple resuscitation, if there had been any resemblance in character
between the Greek <i>revenant</i> and the Slavonic vampire, such an
imprecation would have been impossible where close kinship
existed; it would at once recoil with fatal force upon the curser’s
own head; above all, that most solemn curse, the curse of parent
upon child, would have been the first to ‘come home to roost’;
and yet the use of such parental imprecations is both celebrated
in ballad and not unknown, I am told, in actual experience. Once
more then the use of these curses is explicable only on the hypothesis
that the original Greek <i>revenants</i> were not the formidable
monsters now known as <i>vrykolakes</i>, and that, when under Slavonic
influence the popular conception of them changed, the old set
phrases of commination&mdash;coins, as it were, of speech, struck in
the mint of the original superstition&mdash;continued current in spite
of their inconsistency with the new ideas. These colloquial survivals
of the original Greek superstition are at once a proof and a
measure of its later contamination. The Greeks had believed in
reasonable human <i>revenants</i>; the Slavs taught them to believe in
brutish inhuman vampires.</p>

<p>This conclusion is confirmed by the ballad to which I have
just referred; in it a mother’s imprecation recalls her son from the
grave; the <i>revenant</i>, who is the protagonist in a most dramatic
story, is, as will be seen, of the type which I claim to have been
the original Greek type and exhibits no Slavonic traits.</p>

<p>The ballad<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>, which as an important document I translate at
length, runs as follows:</p>

<p>The versions of this ballad which have been collected are very
numerous<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>, and some of them differ so widely from others in
language as not to have a single line in common. That which
I have selected for translation is one of the most complete, presenting
fairly all the essential points of the story, and free from
the eccentricities which some versions have developed. At the
same time it must be allowed that here the mother’s curse is
only implied by her action of tearing up the gravestones and
adjuring Constantine to rise, whereas in one or two versions,
otherwise inferior, it is clearly and forcibly expressed.</p>

<p>Thus in one<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> her words run:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">πέτρα νὰ γίνῃ ὁ Κωσταντής, λιθάρι νὰ μὴ λει̯ώσῃ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">πώστειλε τὴν Ἀρέτω μου, τὴν Ἀρετὼ ’στὰ ξένα.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘May Constantine become as rock, yea even as stone, and have no loosing
(i.e. dissolution), for that he sent my Areto to a strange land.’</p>
</div>

<p>And in another<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ὅλοι μου οἱ γυιοὶ νὰ λυώσουνε κῂ ὁ Κώστας νὰ μὴ λυώσῃ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ὅπ’ ἔδωκε τὴν Ἀρετὴ πολὺ μακρυὰ ’στὰ ξένα.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘May all my other sons have “loosing” and Constantine be not “loosed,”
for that he let my Areté be taken afar to a strange country.’</p>
</div>

<p>Again, another version<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> ends, not with the arrival of Areté in
time to close her dying mother’s eyes, but with the revoking of
the curse upon Constantine in gratitude for the fulfilment of his
oath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘νὰ σὲ λυώσῃ τὸ χῶμα σου καὶ νὰ σὲ φάγ’ ἡ πλάκα σ’.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ὅσο νὰ σώσ’ τὸ λόγο της χοῦφτα χῶμα γενότον.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘May the earth where thou liest loose thee and thy tomb consume thee.’
Scarce had she finished her speech and he became but a handful of earth.</p>
</div>

<p>Clearly then the curse, which in this story is conceived as
binding Constantine’s body and driving him forth from the grave
and which must be revoked before his body can be loosed by
natural decay, is one of that class which we have been considering;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
but the story confers the further advantage of letting us see such
a curse in operation. Constantine is presented as a revenant, but
not of the modern type; for what turn must the story have taken
if he had been a normal <i>vrykolakas</i>? His first act would have
been to devour his nearest of kin&mdash;his mother, who was tearing up
his grave-stones and cursing him: and his next, if he had troubled
to go as far as Babylon, to make a like end of Areté. And what
do we actually find? Constantine acts not only as a reasonable
man in seeking to allay his sister’s suspicions, but also as a good
man in keeping his oath. He is driven forth from the grave
on a quest which (in most versions of the story) earns him no
thanks from those whom he benefits; he does his weary mission
and (in most versions) goes back again to the cold grave from
which the curse had raised him. Our sympathy is engaged by
Constantine no less than by his mother. He too is a sufferer,
first stricken down in his youth by pestilence, and then cursed
because his oath remained unfulfilled. He claims our pity, and in
this differs fundamentally from the ordinary <i>vrykolakas</i> which could
only excite our horror.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is noteworthy that in the many versions of
this poem, just as in the popular curses which I have quoted, the
word <i>vrykolakas</i> is nowhere found<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>.</p>

<p>Hence I am inclined to believe that the original poem, from
which have come so many modern versions, differing widely in
many respects, but agreeing completely in the exclusion both of
the Slavonic word <i>vrykolakas</i> and of all the suggestions of horror
which surround it, was composed in a period anterior to the intrusion
of Slavonic ideas; and that the modern versions therefore,
which prove their fidelity to the spirit of the original precisely
by having refused admittance to anything Slavonic, furnish that
which we are seeking, the purely and genuinely Greek element in
the now composite superstition. That Greek element then is the
conception of the <i>revenant</i> as a sufferer deserving even of pity, the
very antithesis in character of the Slavonic vampire, an aggressor
exciting only loathing and horror.</p>

<p>In the composite modern Greek superstition, as described in
the last chapter, the Slavonic element is clearly predominant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
But the conclusion to which my analysis of the superstition has
now led, explains what would otherwise have been almost inexplicable,
the existence of a few stories in which the <i>revenant</i>,
though called <i>vrykolakas</i>, is none the less represented as harmless
or even amiable.</p>

<p>One such case is mentioned in Father Richard’s narrative<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>&mdash;the
case of a shoemaker in Santorini, who having turned <i>vrykolakas</i>
continued to frequent his house, mend his children’s shoes,
draw water at the reservoir, and cut wood for the use of his family;
and though it is added that the people became frightened and
exhumed and burned him, this was only a measure of precaution
dictated by their experience of other <i>vrykolakes</i>; no charge was
brought against this particular <i>revenant</i>. It might also be supposed
that the <i>vrykolakes</i> of Amorgos, mentioned next in the same narrative,
who were seen in open day five or six together in a field
feeding apparently on green beans, were of the less noxious kind;
but they may of course have been carnivorous also.</p>

<p>Another story, recently published<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>, records how a native of
Maina, also a shoemaker by trade, having turned <i>vrykolakas</i> issued
from his grave every night except Saturday, resumed his work, and
continued to live with his wife, whose pregnancy forced her to
reveal the truth to her neighbours. When once this was known,
many accusations, it is true, were brought against the <i>vrykolakas</i>;
but the story at least recognises some domestic and human traits
in his character.</p>

<p>But a much more remarkable tale<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> is told of a field-labourer of
Samos who was so devoted to the farmer for whom he worked, that
when he died he became a <i>vrykolakas</i> and continued secretly to
give his services. At night he would go to the farm-buildings,
take out the oxen from their stall, yoke them, and plough three
acres while his master slept; in the daytime an equal piece of
work was done by the master&mdash;so that incidentally the oxen
were nearly killed. The neighbours however having had their
suspicions aroused by the rapidity of the work, which the farmer
himself could in no wise explain, kept watch one night, and having
detected the <i>vrykolakas</i> opened his grave, found him, as would be
expected, whole and incorrupt, and burned him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span></p>

<p>Such stories as these testify that the old and purely Greek
conception of <i>revenants</i> is not quite extinct even in places where
the only name for them is the Slavonic word <i>vrykolakes</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Slavonic element in the modern superstition having been
now removed, it remains to consider what was the attitude of the
Church towards the Greek belief in <i>revenants</i> and what effect
her teaching had upon it.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that the Jesuit, Father Richard,
discriminated between <i>vrykolakes</i> and certain bodies called ‘drums,’
which were found incorrupt after many years of burial. This distinction
he had no doubt learnt from clergy of the Greek Church;
for, while the common-folk held that those whom the earth did not
receive and consume were necessarily ejected by her, or, in other
words, that a dead man whose body did not decay was necessarily
also a <i>revenant</i>, the Church distinguished, as we shall see, between
belief in incorruptibility and belief in resuscitation, inculcating the
former, and varying between condonation and condemnation of the
latter. These two ideas must therefore be handled separately.</p>

<p>The incorruptibility of the body of any person bound by a curse
was made a definite doctrine of the Orthodox Church. In an ecclesiastical
manuscript, seen by Father Richard, were specifications
of the discoloration and other unpleasant symptoms by which the
precise quality of that curse&mdash;parental, episcopal, and so forth&mdash;which
had arrested the decay of a corpse might be diagnosed;
and in one of the forms of absolution which may be read over any
corpse found in such a condition there is a clause which provides
for all possible cases without requiring expert diagnosis: ‘Yea,
O Lord our God, let Thy great mercy and marvellous compassion
prevail; and, whether this Thy servant lieth under curse of father
or mother, or under his own imprecation, or did provoke one of
Thy holy ministers and sustained at his hands a bond that hath
not been loosed, or did incur the most grievous ban of excommunication
by a bishop, and through heedlessness and sloth
obtained not pardon, pardon Thou him by the hand of me Thy
sinful and unworthy servant; resolve Thou his body into that
from which it was made; and stablish his soul in the tabernacle
of saints<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>.’ But the curse to which the Church naturally gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
most prominence and attached most weight was the ban of excommunication;
and therefore, consistently with the accepted doctrine,
the formula of excommunication ended by sentencing the offender
to remain whole and undissolved after death&mdash;a condition from
which the body was not freed unless and until absolution was
read over it and the decree of excommunication thereby rescinded.</p>

<p>This doctrine was held to have the authority of Christ’s own
teaching<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>. The power which was conferred upon the apostles in
the words, ‘Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in
heaven<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>,’ was believed to have been so transmitted to their successors,
the bishops<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> of the Church, that they too had the faculty
of binding and loosing men’s bodies&mdash;that is, of arresting or promoting
their decomposition after death. Such an interpretation
of the text was facilitated by the very simplicity of its wording;
for <span class="greek">λύω</span>, in modern Greek <span class="greek">λυόνω</span>, ‘loose,’ expresses equally well
the ideas of dissolution and of absolution, while <span class="greek">δέω</span>, in modern
Greek <span class="greek">δένω</span>, ‘bind,’ embraces their respective opposites. A <i>nomocanon
de excommunicatis</i><a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>, promulgated in explanation of the fact
that excommunication sometimes failed to produce its expected
result, presents clearly the authorised doctrine and at the same
time illustrates effectively the twofold usage of the words ‘loosing’
and ‘binding.’</p>

<p>‘Concerning excommunicated persons, the which suffer excommunication
by their bishops and after death are found with
their bodies “not loosed” (<span class="greek">ἄλυτα</span>).</p>

<p>‘Certain persons have been justly, reasonably, and lawfully excommunicated
by their bishops, as transgressors of the divine law,
and have died in the state of excommunication without amending
their ways and receiving forgiveness, and have been buried, and in
a short time their bodies have been found “loosed” (<span class="greek">λελυμένα</span>)
and sundered bone from bone....</p>

<p>‘Now this is exceeding marvellous that he who hath been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
lawfully excommunicated should after his death be found with
his body “loosed” (<span class="greek">λελυμένος τὸ σῶμα</span>) and the joints thereof
sundered....’</p>

<p>This ‘exceeding marvellous’ occurrence was therefore submitted
to the consideration of learned divines, whose verdict was to the
effect that any excommunicated person whose body did not remain
whole had no more hope of salvation, because he was no longer in
a state to be ‘loosed’ and forgiven by the bishop who had excommunicated
him<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>, but had become already ‘an inheritor of everlasting
torment.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ continues the <i>nomocanon</i> formulated by these theologians,
‘they that are found excommunicate, to wit, with their bodies whole
and “not loosed” (<span class="greek">ἄλυτα</span>), these stand in need of forgiveness, in
order that the body may attain unto freedom from the “bond”
(<span class="greek">δεσμόν</span>) of excommunication. For even as the body is found
“bound” (<span class="greek">δεδεμένον</span>) in the earth, so is the soul “bound” (<span class="greek">δεδεμένη</span>)
and tormented in the hands of the Devil. And whensoever
the body receive forgiveness and be “loosed” (<span class="greek">λυθῇ</span>) from excommunication,
by power of God the soul likewise is freed from the
hands of the Devil, and receiveth the life eternal, the light that
hath no evening, and the joy ineffable.’</p>

<p>The whole doctrine of the physical results both of excommunication
and of absolution appeared to Leo Allatius to be indisputable,
and he mentions<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> several notable cases in which the truth of it
was demonstrated. Athanasius, Metropolitan of Imbros, is quoted
as recording how at the request of citizens of Thasos he read the
absolution over several incorrupt bodies, ‘and before the absolution
was even finished all the corpses were dissolved into dust.’
A similar case was that of a converted Turk who was subsequently
excommunicated at Naples, and had been dead some years before
he obtained absolution and dissolution at the hands of two Metropolitans.
More remarkable still was a case in which a priest, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
had pronounced a sentence of excommunication, afterwards turned
Mohammedan, while the victim of his curse, though he had died
in the Christian faith, remained ‘bound.’ The matter was reported
to the Patriarch Raphael, and at his instance the Turk, though
after much demur, read the absolution over the Christian’s body,
and towards the end of the reading, ‘the swelling of the body went
down, and it turned completely to dust.’ The Turk thereupon
embraced Christianity once more, and was put to death for doing so.</p>

<p>Most graphic of all is a story attributed to one Malaxus<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>.
The Sultan having been informed&mdash;among other evidences of the
power of Christianity&mdash;that the bodies of the excommunicated
never obtained dissolution till absolution was read over them,
bade seek out such an one and absolve him. The Patriarch of
the time accordingly made enquiries, which resulted in his
hearing of a priest’s widow who had been excommunicated by
a predecessor, the Patriarch Gennadius. Her story was that
having been rebuked by him for prostitution she publicly charged
him with an attempt to seduce her. Gennadius had answered
the charge by praying aloud one Sunday in the presence of all
the clergy, that, if her accusation were true, God would pardon
her all her sins and give her happiness hereafter and let her body,
when she died, dissolve; but, if the charge were slander and
calumny against himself, then by the will and judgement of
Almighty God he exercised his power of severing her from the
communion of the faithful, to remain unpardoned and incorruptible.
Forty days afterwards she had died of dysentery and
having been buried remained incorrupt.</p>

<p>Exhumed at the Sultan’s instance the body was found to be
still sound and whole, of a dark colour and with the skin stretched
like the parchment of a drum. It was then removed and kept for
a certain time under the Sultan’s seal, until the Patriarch decided
to absolve it. As he read the absolution the crackling of the
body as it broke up could be heard from within the coffin. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
then again kept for a few days under the Sultan’s seal, and when
finally the coffin was opened the body was found ‘dissolved and
decomposed, having at last obtained mercy.’ And the Sultan
was so impressed by the miracle that he is recorded to have
exclaimed, ‘Certainly the Christian religion is true beyond all
question.’</p>

<p>Suchlike stories, together with the formula of excommunication
and the <i>nomocanon</i> above quoted, prove conclusively that
the Church did not merely acquiesce in one part of the popular
superstition but authoritatively sanctioned it and utilised it for
her own ends. The incorruptibility of the dead body under
certain conditions was made an article of faith and an instrument
of terrorism, which, as will appear later<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>, the ill-educated peasant-priests
did not scruple to wield widely as an incentive to baptism,
a deterrent from apostasy, and a challenge to repentance.</p>

<p>The name by which ecclesiastical writers designated a person
whose body was thus ‘bound’ by excommunication, was one which
has already been explained, <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖος</span><a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> or, in another form,
<span class="greek">τυμπανίτης</span><a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>&mdash;swollen until the skin is as tight as a drum. This
word, which now survives, so far as I know, only in one island, and
in the seventeenth century, to judge by Leo Allatius’ reference to
it, was certainly less common than the word <i>vrykolakas</i>, had probably
at one time, before Slavonic influence was felt, belonged to
the popular as well as to the ecclesiastical vocabulary; and it
was, I suspect, borrowed by the Church from popular speech at
the same time as she borrowed from popular superstition the
idea of dead bodies being ‘bound’ and withheld from corruption
by a curse.</p>

<p>At what date this appropriation took place I cannot determine;
but it must certainly have been before Slavonic influence was
widely felt; for, when once the Greek <i>revenant</i> had acquired the
baneful characteristics of the Slavonic vampire, the clergy would
surely never have claimed as a new thing the power to ‘bind’ the
dead by excommunication, when the laity (and indeed many of
their own calling too) believed that persons so ‘bound’ became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
rampant and ravening <i>vrykolakes</i>. The belief must therefore
have been incorporated in ecclesiastical doctrine at a time when
the Greek people spoke of the incorrupt dead as <span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖοι</span>,
‘drumlike,’ and conceived of them as reasonable <i>revenants</i>.</p>

<p>The process by which the belief came to obtain the sanction
of the Church is not hard to guess. The ambiguity of the words
<span class="greek">λύω</span>, ‘loose,’ and <span class="greek">δέω</span>, ‘bind,’ may well have been the starting-point.
If, on the one hand, the apostles, or the bishops who
succeeded them, treated certain sins as ‘having no forgiveness
neither in this world nor the world to come,’ and in the exercise
of their power to bind and to loose included in their formula of
excommunication some such phrase as Leo Allatius records, <span class="greek">καὶ
μετὰ τὸν θάνατον ἄλυτος καὶ ἀπαράλυτος</span>, ‘and after death never
to be “loosed”’ (meaning thereby ‘absolved’); while, on the other
hand, the Greek people were hereditarily familiar with a pagan
belief that the dead bodies of persons who lay under a curse were
not ‘loosed’ (in the sense of ‘dissolved’); then the common-folk
for their part would necessarily have understood the ecclesiastical
curse as a sentence of ‘non-dissolution’; while the clergy would
have been less than Greek if they had not seen, and more than
Greek if they had not seized, the handle which popular superstition
gave them, and by adding to their accustomed formula (<span class="greek">μετὰ τὸν
θάνατον ἄλυτος</span>, ‘after death never to be “loosed”’) such apparently
innocent words as <span class="greek">ὥσπερ αἱ πέτραι καὶ τὰ σίδηρα</span><a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>, ‘even
as stone and iron,’ substituted the idea of ‘dissolution’ for that of
‘absolution’ and definitely committed the Church to the old pagan
doctrine.</p>

<p>If this conjecture as to the process by which the popular belief
became an article of the Orthodox faith be correct, a further
suggestion may be made as to the date at which the process
began. If the word ‘loosing’ was misunderstood by the Greeks
when used in the formula of excommunication, it would equally
have been misunderstood in the words of Christ, ‘Whatsoever ye
shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye
shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>.’ Was it then the
knowledge that these words were commonly misinterpreted by the
Greeks which led the author of the fourth Gospel to reproduce
them in a less equivocal form: “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they
are retained<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>”? This would indicate an early date indeed. Yet
the date matters little as compared with the main fact that the
ecclesiastical doctrine of the incorruptibility of excommunicated
persons was at some time borrowed from paganism.</p>

<p>The other half of the popular superstition, namely that those
whose bodies were ‘bound’ by excommunication or otherwise, and
whom the earth did not ‘receive,’ were ejected by her and re-appeared
as <i>revenants</i>, caused the Church some embarrassment.
Sometimes the alleged resuscitation of such persons was condemned
as a mere hallucination of timorous and superstitious
minds; at other times it was accepted as a fact and explained as
a work of the Devil designed to lead men astray, and acting upon
this idea the clergy often lent their services to absolve and to
dissolve the suspected corpse.</p>

<p>Leo Allatius<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> reflects both these views and shows their effect
upon the conduct of the clergy. After describing the actual
appearance of such bodies, which gained for them the name
<span class="greek">τυμπανιαῖοι</span>, ‘drumlike,’ he introduces the second half of the
superstition by saying that into such bodies the devil enters, and
issuing from the tomb goes about working all manner of destruction;
and he adds that when the body is exhumed, ‘the priests
recite prayers, and the body is thrown on a burning pyre; before
the supplications are finished, the joints of the body gradually
fall apart, and all the remains are burnt to ashes.’ Yet shortly
afterwards he states, ‘This belief is not of fresh and recent
growth in Greece; in ancient and modern times alike men of
piety who have received the confessions of Christians have tried
to root it out of the popular mind.’ There is a clear contrast
between the conduct of ‘the priests’ in one passage and that of the
‘men of piety’ in the other. The clergy did not as a body adopt
a single and consistent attitude towards the popular superstition.</p>

<p>Similar inconsistency marks the <i>nomocanon</i> concerning <i>vrykolakes</i>,
from which I have given selections along with the rest of
Leo’s account in the last section; these passages, for convenience of
reference, are here repeated:</p>

<p>‘Concerning a dead man, if such be found whole and incorrupt,
the which they call <i>vrykolakas</i>...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span></p>

<p>‘It is impossible that a dead man become a <i>vrykolakas</i> save it
be that the Devil, wishing to delude some that they may do things
unmeet and incur the wrath of God, maketh these portents and
oft-times at night <i>causeth men to imagine</i> that the dead man
whom they knew before cometh and speaketh with them, and in
their dreams too they see visions. Other times they see him in
the road, walking or standing still, and, more than this, he even
throttles men.</p>

<p>‘Then there is a commotion and they run to the grave and dig
to see the remains of the man ... and the dead man&mdash;one who has
long been dead and buried&mdash;<i>appears to them</i> to have flesh and
blood and nails and hair ... and they collect wood and set fire to
it and burn the body and do away with it altogether....’</p>

<p>Then, after denying again the reality of such things which
exist <span class="greek">κατὰ φαντασίαν</span>, <i>in imagination only</i>, the <i>nomocanon</i>
continues:</p>

<p>‘But know that <i>when such remains be found</i>, the which, as we
have said, is a work of the Devil, ye must summon the priests to
chant an invocation of the Mother of God, ... and <i>to perform
memorial services for the dead</i> with funeral meats.’</p>

<p>The self-contradiction of the pronouncement is exposed in the
phrases which I have italicised. Clearly if such remains are
found and the dead man is so affected by the work of the Devil
that special services for his repose<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> are required, the theory of
hallucination is untenable. But this very inconsistency of the
<i>nomocanon</i>, though according to Allatius it is of uncertain authorship,
proves it, as I will show, a very valuable document of the
Church’s traditional teaching on this matter.</p>

<p>S. Anastasius Sinaita, who became bishop of Antioch in 561
and died in 599, refers to <i>revenants</i> in a passage which, literally
rendered, runs as follows<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>: ‘Again it appears that devils, by
means of false prophets who obey them and with their aid work
signs and heal bodily diseases to the delusion of themselves and
others, present even a dead man as risen again, and (in his person)
talk with the living, in imagination (<span class="greek">ἐν φαντασίᾳ</span>). For a devil
enters into the dead body of the man, and moves it, presenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
the dead man risen again as it were in answer to the foolish
prayer of the deceiver. And the evil spirit talks as it were in
the person of the dead man with him whom he is deluding,
telling him such things as he himself wishes to tell and answering
also further questions....’</p>

<p>In this passage Anastasius is clearly thinking of <i>revenants</i>
called up by sorcerers; in his time, when the first Slavonic invaders
had only just entered Greece and anything like friendly
intercourse between the two races was still a thing of the future,
the conception of a real vampire was not yet known to the Greeks
of Greece proper, much less to those of Antioch; and it is easy
therefore to believe that the calling up of harmless <i>revenants</i> was
then a recognised department of witchcraft, which afterwards lost
its attractions. The particular circumstances however to which
Anastasius refers are of minor importance; the interest of the
passage lies in its inconsistency of thought, which results indeed
in a certain confusion of language; for to say that ‘it appears
that devils ... present even a dead man as risen again, and talk
with the living in imagination,’ would be not a little obscure, if
the context did not throw light upon the meaning. More lucidly
expressed the ideas are these: men see a dead person apparently
risen from his grave and able to talk with them; the raising of
the dead is the work of a devil (whose <i>modus operandi</i> is described
in the second sentence); the talking is also done by the devil (as
explained in the third sentence); and finally the whole thing is an
hallucination.</p>

<p>Here then are the same contradictory doctrines as in the
<i>nomocanon</i>; the resuscitation of the dead man is the work of a
devil who enters into the corpse and moves it and raises it from
the grave; and yet it is the ‘imagination’ of the men who see
it which is at fault. But it can be no casual coincidence that
S. Anastasius in the sixth century and a <i>nomocanon</i> which was
quoted as authoritative in the seventeenth attempted to combine
two incompatible doctrines concerning the re-appearance of the
dead. Rather is it proof that from a very early age the Church
remained halting between two opinions; and the attitude adopted
towards the superstition by the clergy, some of whom, according
to Leo Allatius, had long tried to root it out of the popular mind,
while others rendered aid in absolving suspected corpses, naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
varied according as they personally believed that <i>revenants</i> (including
<i>vrykolakes</i>) were a figment of the people’s imagination or
a real work of the Devil.</p>

<p>Now of these two ecclesiastical views, which are really alternative
and incompatible although attempts were made to combine
them, the former has clearly had little or no effect upon the
people; in spite of the efforts of the ‘men of piety who received
the confessions of Christians<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>’ to extirpate the superstition, it
remains vigorous, as we have seen, down to this day. But the
explanation of the phenomenon as a work of the Devil was readily
entertained; even educated men were convinced of it. ‘It is
the height of folly,’ says Leo Allatius, speaking for himself, ‘to
deny altogether that such bodies are sometimes found incorrupt
in the graves, and that by use of them the Devil, if God permit
him, devises horrible plans to the hurt of the human race’; and
similarly Father Richard opens his account of <i>vrykolakes</i> with the
statement that the Devil sometimes works by means of dead
bodies which he preserves in their entirety and re-animates. As
for the common-folk, the explanation accorded so well with the
diabolical characteristics of the <i>vrykolakas</i> that they could hardly
have failed to accept it.</p>

<p>The popularisation of this view is well illustrated by a local
interpretation set upon a custom which I have already discussed,
the so-called custom of ‘Charon’s obol.’ I have shown that the
practice of placing a coin or other object in the mouth of the dead
continues down to the present day; that the classical notion, that
the coin was intended as payment for the ferryman of the Styx,
was only a temporary and probably local misinterpretation of the
custom; and that the coin or other object employed was really a
charm designed to prevent any evil spirit from entering (or possibly
the soul from re-entering) the dead body. Now in Chios and in
Rhodes this original intention has not been forgotten, and is combined
with the belief in <i>vrykolakes</i>. In the former island the
woman who prepares the corpse for burial places on its lips a cross
of wax or cotton-stuff, and the priest also during the funeral
service prepares a fragment of pottery to be laid in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
place by marking on it the sign of the cross and the letters
I. X. N. K. (<span class="greek">Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς νικᾷ</span>, ‘Jesus Christ conquers’), both
of them with the avowed purpose of preventing any evil spirit
from entering the dead body and making of it a <i>vrykolakas</i><a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>. In
Rhodes a piece of ancient pottery, inscribed with the same words
but marked with the pentacle<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> instead of the cross, is placed in
the mouth of the dead for the same purpose<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>. Clearly then in
these two islands this ecclesiastical view has been fully accepted
by the people; and what I can illustrate by customs in these cases
I know to be equally true of Greece in general. Whenever an
explanation is sought of the resuscitation of the dead, the answer,
if any be forthcoming, lays the responsibility for it on the Devil.</p>

<p>This opinion, as I have said, is abundantly justified by the
conduct of modern <i>vrykolakes</i>; but I am inclined to think that it
was held also, by the Church at any rate, in the pre-Slavonic age
when <i>revenants</i> were of a less diabolical character. The actual
practice of excommunication was thought to have been instituted
by St Paul<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>, who twice speaks of ‘delivering persons unto Satan<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>.’
The early ecclesiastical interpretation of this phrase is clearly
given by Theodoretus<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>; commenting upon the sentence, “To
deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,” he
draws special attention to the fact that the body, and not the soul,
is to be subjected to diabolic affliction, and then adds, ‘We are
taught by this, that those who are excommunicated, that is to say,
severed from the body of the Church, will be assailed by the devil
when he finds them void of grace.’ In other words, the bodily
punishment inflicted by the act of excommunication was ‘possession’
by the devil.</p>

<p>Now Theodoretus, it is true, says nothing in this passage as to
the continuance of the punishment after death. But clearly if
demoniacal possession was the effect of excommunication, and if
also, as we have seen, the sentence of excommunication remained
valid after death, it must have followed that the dead body no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
than the living body was possessed of the devil; and if the devil
in possession of the corpse chose to agitate it and drive it out of
the grave, the dead demoniac was at once a <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>There is therefore some probability that, though the Church
never threatened the excommunicated with resuscitation but only
with incorruptibility, she may at a very early date have offered
this explanation of their alleged re-appearance; and the theory
of diabolical agency may have gained popular approval from the
first; for resuscitation was originally viewed by the Greek people
as a calamity befalling the dead man, not as a source of danger to
the living; and therefore an ecclesiastical doctrine, that it was by
delivering an offender unto Satan that the curse of the Church
rendered him a <i>revenant</i>, would have been felt to be a perfectly
satisfactory, if novel, explanation of the process by which a known
cause, imprecation, produced its known effect, resuscitation.</p>

<p>But, whatever the date at which the theory of diabolical
possession was first developed and disseminated, the Church, and
the Church only, was responsible for it. The Devil is a Christian
conception, just as the vampire is Slavonic. Both must go, if
the modern superstition is to be stripped of its accretions, and
the genuinely Hellenic elements discovered. What then remains?
Simply the belief that the bodies of certain classes of
persons did not decay away in their graves but returned therefrom,
and the feeling that such persons were sufferers deserving of
pity. What then were the classes of persons so affected, according
to the original Greek superstition?</p>

<p>The classes now regarded as liable to become <i>vrykolakes</i> were
enumerated at the end of the last section. But both Slavonic
and Christian influences have been felt here, as in the rest of the
superstition. I must therefore take those classes one by one, and
indicate the origin of each. None of them will require long
discussion; their <i>provenance</i> is in many cases self-evident.</p>

<p>(1) Those who have not received the full and due rites of
burial.</p>

<p>Here there can be no reason for supposing any alien influence;
on the contrary, the high importance attached by the ancient
Greeks to funeral-rites is everywhere apparent. It was these
which Patroclus’ spirit returned to implore; these which Antigone
risked her life to give. The sin of Clytemnestra culminated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
that she ‘dared to bury her husband without mourning or lamentation<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>’&mdash;an
essential part of the Greek funeral; and again in
historical times Lysander’s honour was tarnished not so much
because he put to death some prisoners of war, but because ‘he
did not throw earth even upon their dead bodies<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>.’ What effect
such neglect was anciently believed to have upon the dead is a
question to be considered later; but the general idea is plainly
Hellenic.</p>

<p>(2) Those who meet with any sudden or violent death (including
suicides), or, in Maina, where the vendetta is still in vogue,
those who having been murdered remain unavenged.</p>

<p>The most important element in this class is formed by those
who have been murdered, especially when, as in Maina, they are
believed to return from the grave with the purpose of seeking
revenge upon their murderers. Such an idea, as will be shown
later, is thoroughly consonant with ancient views of bloodguilt.
But it appears also from a passage of Lucian<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> that any ‘violent’
or ‘sudden,’ as opposed to ‘natural,’ death was commonly held to
debar the victim from rest no less effectually than actual murder.
The whole class may therefore be accepted as Hellenic, and may
probably be considered to have always comprised all persons
whose lives were cut short suddenly before their proper hour had
come.</p>

<p>(3) Children conceived or born on one of the great Church-festivals,
and children still-born.</p>

<p>The first division of this class may be variously explained;
either the child may be supposed to suffer for the sin committed
by its parents on a day when the Church enjoins continence,
or else the notion, that children born between Christmas and
Epiphany are subject to lycanthropy<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> and therefore also, according
to Slavonic views, to vampirism, has become associated with other
church-festivals also. Children still-born are probably to be
numbered among victims of ‘sudden’ death. Thus the first
division, being of ecclesiastical or Slavonic origin, is to be set
aside; the second may probably be included in a larger Hellenic
class already considered; neither therefore requires any further
discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span></p>

<p>(4) Those who die under a curse, especially the curse of a
parent, or one self-invoked, as in the case of a man who in perjuring
himself calls down on his own head all manner of damnation if
what he says be false.</p>

<p>The dread which a curse, above all a parent’s curse, excited in
the ancient Greeks is well known. No one can have read Aeschylus’
story of the house of Atreus, nor followed with Sophocles the
fortunes of Oedipus and his children, without perceiving therein
the working of a curse that claims fulfilment and cannot be averted.
The idea therefore here involved is purely Hellenic.</p>

<p>(5) Those who die under the ban of the Church, that is to
say, excommunicate.</p>

<p>This class is an ecclesiastical variety of the last.</p>

<p>(6) Those who die unbaptised or apostate.</p>

<p>The apostate is of course <i>ipso facto</i> excommunicate, even
though no formal sentence have been pronounced against him.
The unbaptised have probably been included by priestcraft for
purposes of intimidation; baptism is commonly held to prevent
children from becoming were-wolves, and therefore also <i>vrykolakes</i>
at death.</p>

<p>(7) Men of evil and immoral life in general, more particularly
if they have dealt in the blacker kinds of sorcery.</p>

<p>Clerical influence is clearly discernible here, but is not, I think,
responsible for the whole idea. A story from Zacynthos<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> records
how the treacherous murderer of a good man was first smitten by
a thunderbolt so that he lost both his sight and his reason, and
after his death was turned by God into a <i>vrykolakas</i> as a punishment
for his crime, and has so remained for a thousand years.
Here, in spite of the word <i>vrykolakas</i> being used, the <i>revenant</i> is
represented, like Constantine in the popular ballad, as a sufferer.
This idea has been shown to be pre-Slavonic&mdash;and incidentally
it is not a little curious that the story itself claims to date from a
thousand years ago, when this idea was only beginning to be
ousted by Slavonic superstition. But if the idea of ‘punishment’
is old, the idea that the punishment was merited by a crime
must be equally old. For this reason, and for others which will be
developed later, I hold that the perpetrators of certain deadly
sins were from early times regarded as accursed and subject to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
same punishment as befell those on whom a curse had actually
been called down. The Church, I think, merely added to the
number of those sins, and at the same time undertook the task of
pronouncing in many cases the curse which they had earned.</p>

<p>(8) Those who have eaten the flesh of a sheep which was
killed by a wolf.</p>

<p>This class is purely Slavonic in origin. To become a were-wolf
in consequence of having eaten flesh which a wolf’s fangs have
infected with madness is to a simple mind rational enough; and
a were-wolf becomes after death a vampire. Further the belief,
so far as I know, belongs only to Elis, one of the districts where
Slavonic ascendancy was most complete and continued longest.</p>

<p>(9) Those over whose dead bodies a cat or other animal has
passed.</p>

<p>This class also is Slavonic. The jumping of a cat over a dead
body is still believed by some Slavonic peoples to be a cause of
vampirism<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>, while in Greece the idea is rare and local only.</p>

<p>Thus out of the many conditions by which, in modern belief,
a man is predisposed to turn <i>vrykolakas</i>, only three can be genuinely
Hellenic: first, lack of burial; second, a sudden or violent death;
and third, a parental or other curse, or such sin as renders a man
accursed. The <i>revenant</i> therefore was regarded, as we inferred
also from the story of Constantine and Areté, as a sufferer. His
suffering might be the result of pure mischance, as in the case of
sudden death, or of neglect on the part of those whose duty it was
to lament and to bury him, or again of some sin of his own which
had merited a curse. But whether he was the victim of sheer
misfortune or of punishment, he was still a sufferer, an object to
excite the pity of mankind in general, although in special cases,
as when he had been murdered or had not received the last offices
of love at the hands of his kinsfolk, he might reasonably be feared
by those who had injured him as an avenger.</p>

<p>Since then in the pre-Slavonic period the general feeling
towards <i>revenants</i> was a feeling of pity, the treatment of them in
that period requires investigation.</p>

<p>Starting once more from the modern superstition, we find that
the treatment of <i>vrykolakes</i> by the Greeks differs widely from
that accorded by the Slavs to vampires. The Slavonic method is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
generally to pierce the suspected corpse with a stake of aspen or
whitethorn, taking care to drive it right through the heart at one
blow. The usual Greek method is to burn the body. The Greeks
therefore, who learnt from the Slavs all that is most horrible
in their conception of <i>vrykolakes</i>, none the less thought that
they knew a better way of disposing of these new-found pests
than that which was practised by their teachers. Convinced by
foreign influence of the danger, they relied on a native method
of obviating it. They would not impale the <i>vrykolakas</i>; they
would burn him. Clearly there must have been some strong
conviction and assurance in the heart of a people who, freshly
persuaded of the peril threatening them at the hands of so loathly
and savage a monster, yet chose to pursue their own method of
combating it rather than to adopt the foreign and repugnant
practice of impaling the dead. That conviction plainly was that
cremation, by ensuring the immediate and complete dissolution
of the body, put an end to all relations of the dead with the
living; and their confidence in it can only have been based upon
their own experience in the treatment of the Greek species of
<i>revenants</i>. Cremation then was the means by which the Greek
folk had always been wont to succour those of the dead who
suffered from incorruptibility and resuscitation.</p>

<p>Such a custom would not, so far as I can judge, have encountered
any serious ecclesiastical opposition. The Church, it is
true, in her earlier days had condemned cremation as a pagan
rite, and with the spread of Christianity inhumation became the
ordinary rite. But in the case of those who, having been buried,
yet returned from the grave, since the Christian rite had proved
of no avail, some concession to pagan traditions would have been
natural. Many of the clergy, as we have seen, condoned cremation
in the case of <i>vrykolakes</i> as a measure of self-defence; surely
they would equally have allowed it as an act of charity to more
innocent men to whom the earth had denied dissolution and death
had brought no repose.</p>

<p>Thus the actual custom of burning dates from the pre-Slavonic
era; it is only the motive of the act which is changed. Formerly
men felt pity for the <i>revenant</i>, and sought to promote his dissolution
in order to release him from a state of suffering; now, as for
some centuries past, men feel only horror of the <i>vrykolakas</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
seek to promote his dissolution in order to release themselves
from a state of peril. Hence no doubt came the more horrible
barbarities occasionally inflicted on the corpse; to tear out the
heart, to boil it in vinegar, to tear the body to shreds&mdash;these are
the acts of a panic-stricken and vindictive people eager to
torment their foe before annihilating him. But in the old custom
of cremation there was nothing inhumane; it was the merciful
act of a people who had compassion upon the unquiet dead and
gave to them, in solicitude for their welfare, that boon of bodily
dissolution by which alone they were finally severed from the
living and admitted to the world of the departed.</p>

</div>

<p>The Slavonic and the ecclesiastical elements have now been
removed from the modern Greek superstition, and the Hellenic
residue is briefly this: the human body sometimes remains incorruptible
in the earth, and in this state is liable to resuscitation;
persons so affected stand as it were halfway between the living
and the dead, resembling the former when they walk the earth,
and the latter when they are lying quiet in their graves or, if
unburied, elsewhere; during their periods of resuscitation they
act as reasonable human beings, but their whole condition is
pitiable, and the most humane way of treating them is to burn
their bodies; disintegration being thus secured, they return no
more to this world, but are numbered among the departed.
Further the causes of such a condition are threefold&mdash;lack of
burial, sudden death, and execration or deadly sin deserving of it.
The only question which we have left unsolved is that of the
agency by which the body is resuscitated. The Devil is now
held responsible; but the Devil is a Christian, not a pagan,
conception.</p>

<p>My purpose in the present section is, first, to verify by the
aid of classical literature the conclusions which have been reached,
and, secondly, to solve the one problem which remains.</p>

<p>There is, so far as I know, only one story in ancient literature
which contains anything like a full account of a <i>revenant</i>. This is
related by Phlegon<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>, a freedman of Hadrian; and the narrator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
professes to have been an eye-witness of the occurrences which he
describes. In his story are embodied most of those very ideas
which on wholly other grounds have been argued to form the
genuine Hellenic element in the modern superstition concerning
<i>vrykolakes</i>, and I shall therefore reproduce it at length. Unfortunately
however the beginning of the story is lost, and therewith
possibly the cause assigned for the strange conduct of the
resuscitated corpse which plays the heroine’s part.</p>

<p>What remains of the story opens abruptly with a weird scene
in the guest-chamber of the house of Demostratus and his wife
Charito.</p>

<p>Their daughter Philinnion had been dead and buried somewhat
less than six months, when one evening she was observed by her
old nurse in the guest-chamber, where a young man named
Machates was lodged, to all appearances alive. The nurse at
once ran to the girl’s parents and bade them come with her and
see their child. Charito however was so overcome by the tidings
that she first fainted and then wept hysterically for her lost
daughter and finally began to abuse the old woman, calling her
mad and ordering her out of the room; but the nurse expostulated
with spirit, and Charito at last went with her. In the meanwhile
however Philinnion and her lover had retired to rest, so that when
the mother arrived she could not obtain a good view of her; but
from the peep which she got of the girl’s clothes and the shape of
her face she thought that she recognised her daughter. Then,
feeling that she could not at that hour ascertain the truth of the
matter, she decided to keep quiet until morning, and then to rise
betimes and surprise the girl if still there, or, failing that, to
extort from Machates the whole truth.</p>

<p>But when dawn came the girl had gone away unobserved, and
Charito began to take Machates to task, telling him the whole
story and imploring him to confess the truth and to keep nothing
back. The young man (who seems to have been unaware that
Charito had lost a daughter named Philinnion) was much distressed,
and at first would only admit that such was indeed the
name of the girl whom they had seen; but afterwards he told the
whole story of the girl’s visits to him, mentioning that she had
said that she came without her parents’ knowledge. To confirm
his story, he produced the gold ring which she had given him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
her breast-band which she had left behind on the previous night.
These were at once recognised by Charito as having belonged to
her daughter, and with a loud cry she rent her clothes and loosed
her hair and threw herself upon the ground beside the tokens and
began making lamentation anew. Her example was soon followed
by others of the family as if in preparation for a funeral, and
Machates, at his wits’ end how to quiet them, promised to let
them see the girl if she should come to him again.</p>

<p>That night accordingly they kept watch, and at the usual
hour the girl came, went into Machates’ room, and sat down upon
the bed. The young man himself was now anxious to learn the
truth; he could not wholly credit the supposition that it was a
dead woman who had come so regularly, and who had eaten and
drunk with him and lain at his side, and thought rather that the
real Philinnion’s tomb had been robbed and the booty sold to the
father of the girl, whoever she might be, who visited him. No
sooner therefore was she come than he quietly summoned the
watchers. The girl’s parents at once entered, and were for a
while dumb with astonishment at the sight of her, and then threw
their arms round her with loud cries. Then said Philinnion,
‘O my mother and father, it was wrong of you to grudge me three
days with this man here in my own home and doing no harm.
And so, because of your meddlesomeness, you shall mourn for me
anew, and I shall go away again to my appointed place. For it
is by divine consent that I have done thus.’ Scarcely had she
spoken when she became a corpse and her body lay stretched
upon the bed in the sight of all. Confusion and loud lamentation
at once ensued, and before long the rumour had got about the
town and was reported to the narrator of the story, Phlegon, who
appears to have held some official position. To him at any rate it
fell to keep order during the night among the excited townsfolk,
and early next morning he was present at a crowded meeting in
the theatre, at which it was decided to inspect first of all the
family vault in which Philinnion had been laid.</p>

<p>The vault having been opened, on all the shelves, save that
appropriated to Philinnion, were found bodies or bones; but on
hers there was nothing except an iron ring belonging to Machates
and a gilt cup&mdash;presents which she had received from him at
her first visit. Horror-stricken the party left the vault and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
straight to Demostratus’ house, and in the guest-chamber saw the
girl stretched upon the floor. Thence they returned to another
public assembly as crowded as the first, at which one Hyllus, who
was reputed not only the best seer of the place but also a clever
diviner<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> and possessed of a comprehensive knowledge of other
branches of the profession, advised that the girl’s body should be
taken outside the boundaries of the town and should be burnt
to ashes&mdash;it was inexpedient, he said, for her to be buried in the
town&mdash;and that certain propitiatory rites, accompanied by a
general purification, should be paid to Hermes Chthonios and
the Eumenides.</p>

<p>The strange episode ended with the acceptance of this advice
by the townspeople and the suicide of Machates.</p>

<p>This story was known to Father Richard of Santorini<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>, who
recognised in it an ancient case parallel to some which he himself
had witnessed or learnt from other eye-witnesses in his own times.
Even the harmless character of Philinnion did not appear to him
incompatible with the popular conception of <i>vrykolakes</i>. Indeed,
as we saw above, he himself mentions, among the many instances
known to him, one in which a shoemaker of Santorini, having
turned <i>vrykolakas</i>, manifested no vicious tendencies, but rather
the greatest affection and solicitude for his wife and children.</p>

<p>Nor again is the incident of Philinnion’s intercourse with
Machates unparalleled in modern times. Many travellers and
writers<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> have concurred in recording the belief that the <i>vrykolakas</i>
sometimes revisits his widow, or does violence to other women
in their husbands’ absence, or even marries again in some place
where he is unknown, and that of such unions children have been
born. Indeed in the Middle Ages this belief seems to have spread
even beyond the confines of Greece; for a Roman priest, early in
the seventeenth century, sums up the views of his Church on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
subject as follows<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>: ‘Devils, though incorporeal and spiritual, can
take to themselves the bodies of dead men ... and in such bodies
can have intercourse with women, as commonly with <i>striges</i><a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> and
witches, and by such union can even beget children.’ This
statement would be a fair ecclesiastical summary of modern Greek
belief. In Thessaly I myself was told of a family in the neighbourhood
of Domoko, who reckoned a <i>vrykolakas</i> among their
ancestors of the second or third generation back, and by virtue of
such lineage inherited a special skill (such as is more commonly
ascribed to <span class="greek">σαββατογεννημένοι</span>, ‘men born on a Saturday,’ when
<i>vrykolakes</i> usually rest in their graves, or to <span class="greek">ἀλαφροστοίχει̯ωτοι</span><a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>,
those who are in close touch with a ‘familiar spirit,’) in dealing
with those <i>vrykolakes</i> which from time to time troubled the
country-side; indeed they had been summoned, I was assured, even
to remote districts for consultation as specialists.</p>

<p>The story of Philinnion was not overlooked by Bernhard
Schmidt, but he does not appear to have recognised in it anything
more relevant than in the ancient ghost-stories (<i>gespenstergeschichten</i>)
among which he reckons it<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>. Most emphatically
this is no ghost-story. The distinction between ghosts and Greek
<i>revenants</i> is of a primary and universal nature, patent to all who
can discriminate between soul and body. In this story Philinnion
acts as a <i>revenant</i> and is treated as a <i>revenant</i>; the inspection of
the vault in which her body had been laid and the purpose of her
nocturnal visits to Machates furnish conclusive evidence of her
corporeal resuscitation; and the method of disposing of her corpse
is the method generally approved and employed in the case of
<i>revenants</i>&mdash;cremation. In effect all that remains of the story is
in complete accord with what I have claimed on other grounds as
the Hellenic element in the modern superstition; only one detail
is wanting&mdash;the cause of Philinnion’s resuscitation&mdash;and if we
had the first part of the story, it is not unlikely that in it we
should find that her early death had been also sudden or violent.
Clearly then the belief in <i>revenants</i> was known in Greece in the
age of Hadrian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span></p>

<p>A casual allusion to the same superstition occurs also in
Lucian<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>. ‘I know of a man,’ says a doctor named Antigonus,
‘who rose again twenty days after he was buried; I attended him
after his resurrection as well as before his death.’ ‘But how was
it,’ rejoins another, ‘that in twenty days the body did not decompose
or in any case the man perish of hunger?’ Unfortunately
no answer is given and the subject drops, but the man in question
was clearly a corporeal <i>revenant</i> and not a mere ghost.</p>

<p>A reference to the same vulgar belief is also seemingly intended
by Aristophanes in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>, where the personal appearance
of one of the reprobate old women calls forth the
exclamation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Is yon an ape be-plastered with white lead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or an old hag uprisen from the dead?’<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The passage is of course too brief to make any such allusion
certain; but it becomes highly probable if it can be shown from
other sources that the superstition was popularly current in
Aristophanes’ time. This I can do.</p>

<p>The fixity of popular phrases of imprecation has been amply
demonstrated in the last section<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>. A large selection of curses,
all conceived in the same spirit, furnished, by their contrast with
some features of the now contaminated superstition, a clue for the
detection of the Slavonic elements therein. These imprecations,
we learnt, were based upon the purely Hellenic belief, and had
remained unaffected by the foreign influence which had modified
and in some respects almost transformed it. Spoken often in a
moment of passion, springing spontaneously and familiarly to the
lips, too hasty to be informed by conscious thought, such curses
have been handed down from generation to generation as fixed
expressions subject to none of the changes which come of deliberate
reflection. Though the old beliefs have been altered by the infusion
of alien doctrines, the old curses stand fast in bold antagonism
to all foreign lore, true records of a superstition now garbled, coins
stamped with the effigy and superscription of by-gone thought, but
current still.</p>

<p>As the simplest types of these old-established curses may be
taken the two phrases, <span class="greek">νὰ μὴν τὸν δεχτῇ ἡ γῆς</span>, ‘May the earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
not receive him,’ and <span class="greek">νὰ τὸν βγάλῃ ἡ γῆς</span>, ‘May the earth cast him
out.’ The one is negative in form, the other positive, but both
equally suggest, in the peasant’s mind, both the incorruptibility
of the body and its resuscitation. Can a prototype of these
curses be found in ancient literature? If so, in view of the
general continuity of Greek belief and custom, we shall be
justified in concluding that, as those ancient curses are identical
with the modern, so the superstition which suggested them in
old time is identical with that part of the modern superstition on
which they are now based.</p>

<p>Two examples of these curses are furnished by Euripides. In
a scene where Orestes conjures his comrade Pylades to leave him
and not to involve himself in the meditated act of vengeance, the
latter replies<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>, ‘Never may the fruitful earth receive my blood,
nor yet the gleaming air, if ever I turn traitor to thee and save
myself and forsake thee!’ In like tone rings out Hippolytus’
assertion of his innocence toward his father<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>: ‘Now by Zeus the
judge of oaths and by the earth beneath our feet, I swear that
never have I touched thy marriage-bed, nor would have willed it
nor conceived the thought. May I verily perish without glory
and without name, cityless and homeless, an outcast and wanderer
upon the earth, yea and in death may neither sea nor earth
receive my flesh, if I have proved false!’</p>

<p>‘May the earth not receive my flesh!’ Such is the common
burden of the two oaths; such the final chord struck by Hippolytus
in that symphony of imprecations with which he vindicates his
innocence; such too would be the strongest oath by which
any peasant of to-day might bind himself. The very words have
scarcely varied in a score of centuries; who then will venture to
claim that their purport is changed? Is it not clear that just as in
later times the Church, by incorporating the popular curse in her
formula of excommunication, seized the weapons of paganism and
turned them against those rebels and infidels whom her own direst
fulminations had no power to dismay, so Euripides, conscious
that no imaginings of his own art could suffice to excite in his
hearers that horror which the climax of self-execration demanded,
did not disdain ‘the touchings of things common,’ but turned to
tragic use a popular curse which then, as now, pierced home to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
every heart? It would be strange indeed if words, which since
early in the Christian era have continuously implied a belief in
the indissolubility and resuscitation of those who die accursed,
should be held to have borne some other meaning a few centuries
earlier.</p>

<p>Thus then Euripides, by the identity of his language with
that of to-day, discovers most conspicuously his knowledge of that
which on other grounds I have shown to be the Hellenic element
in the superstition concerning <i>vrykolakes</i>. But he was not alone
in employing it for dramatic purposes. In the pages of Sophocles
too and of Aeschylus there are passages which only a knowledge
of this superstition can adequately explain. First among these is
the climax of that speech in which Oedipus, blind and outcast,
denounces his undutiful son:</p>

<p>‘Begone, abhorred and renounced of me thy father, thou basest
villain, and take with thee these curses that I call down upon
thee, that thou win not with thy spear that land of thine own
kin, nor yet return ever again to the vale of Argos, but that thou
and he that drave thee forth, smiting and smitten, fall each by
a brother’s hand. Such is my curse; yea, and I call on Tartarus,
in whose hated gloom my father lies, to drive thee from his
home<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a>.’</p>

<p>The last phrase of this denunciation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent16">καὶ καλῶ τοῦ Ταρτάρου</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">στυγνὸν πατρῷον Ἔρεβος, ὥς σ’ ἀποικίσῃ,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>is that with which I am concerned. It is an old-established
difficulty. Commentators have translated variously ‘to remove
thee from thy home,’ ‘to take thee away to his home,’ ‘to give
thee another home’; but in effect they are all agreed in trying
to make the words refer to removal from this to the nether world,
or, in one word, to death. Now even if the word <span class="greek">ἀποικίζω</span> could
in this context bear any of the meanings ascribed to it, such an
euphemism following upon the explicit threat that Polynices
should be slain by his own brother’s hand would be an imbecile
anticlimax; but I question the very possibility of the supposed
usage. It is true that an emigrant from one place becomes an
immigrant into another; but that cannot justify the interchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
of the two terms. Tartarus is here besought, as plainly as
language can express it, to drive Polynices out, not to take him
in. There can be only one explanation of that prayer. Polynices’
death has already been foretold; but his father’s curse pursues
him beyond death. Tartarus, in whose keeping the dead should
lie, is conjured to drive him forth from the home of the dead,
even as the peasants now pray that the earth may cast out those
whom they hate.</p>

<p>And the context shows clearly that the curse was so understood
by Polynices. Turning to Antigone and Ismene with impassioned
entreaty he implores them&mdash;them at least, though all
others forsake him and turn against him&mdash;if so be his father’s
cruel imprecations come to fulfilment and they, his sisters, ever
return to their home, not to leave him dishonoured, but to lay
him in the grave and to grant him the guerdons of the dead<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>.
Why then this insistence, unless the father’s curse had extended
beyond death? Merely to introduce a reference to the plot of
the <i>Antigone</i>? Clearly more than that. Polynices was to die
bound by his father’s curse, slain by his brother’s hand, doubly
debarred, if modern beliefs be a key to ancient, from dissolution
and from reception into the nether world. The words of his
father’s invocation of Tartarus had conveyed to his mind the
certainty of a doom outlasting death, that Tartarus should not
receive him, but reject him from the home of the dead. Only
one faint gleam of hope was left, that by the fulfilment of those
last offices of love toward the departed, which were for all men
a passport to the lower world, he, burdened and bound with a
father’s curse, both slayer and slain of his own brother, might
yet be not debarred from his last home, but free to enter
into rest.</p>

<p>Thus Sophocles in language less popular, but hardly less clear,
than that of Euripides proclaims that the belief in the non-dissolution
or rejection of the body by the earth and the powers
under the earth was a terror as potent then as it is now, and
an ever effective weapon of malediction. Aeschylus had gone
even further, and, by enlisting this terror among the threats
uttered on behalf of a dead man by a god in his most holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>
sanctuary, had claimed as it were for the popular superstition the
highest religious sanction.</p>

<p>In the <i>Choephori</i><a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> Orestes is made to review in a speech as
difficult as it is powerful the motives which are urging him on
to the requital of blood with blood. Most cogent among these
motives is the explicit command issued from Apollo’s Delphic
shrine, bidding him not spare his father’s murderess, mother
though she be, and foretelling the direst penalties for disobedience.
And what are these penalties? First, the physical
torment of ‘blains that leap upon the flesh and with savage jaws
eat out its erstwhile vigour’; second, the mental horror of coming
madness, ‘the arrow that flieth in darkness winged by the powers
of hell with the curse of fallen kindred, even raving and vain
terror born of the night’; third, banishment from home and city,
with no place at friendly board, no part in drink-offering and
sacrifice; and yet one penalty more wherein should culminate the
threatened agonies, ‘to die at last with none to honour, none
to love him, damned, even in the doom that wastes all, to know
no corruption.’</p>

<p>Of the earlier penalties and of their intimate connexion with
one branch of this popular superstition I shall have occasion to
speak later. Here I have only to justify the new rendering which
I have given to the last lines of the passage,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">πάντων δ’ ἄτιμον κἄφιλον θνήσκειν χρόνῳ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">κακῶς ταριχευθέντα παμφθάρτῳ μόρῳ<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has generally been held that <span class="greek">ταριχευθέντα</span> is here metaphorically
used of the wasting or withering of the body through
physical suffering, the first penalty, or, it may be, through mental
distress, the second. In other words, the last line of the passage
merely sums up in a concise expression a penalty, or penalties,
previously detailed. On the same view it is but consistent to
regard <span class="greek">πάντων ἄτιμον κἄφιλον</span> as a similar summary of the third
penalty. Stripped of these recapitulations and vain repetitions
Apollo’s final threat amounts to&mdash;what? <span class="greek">θνήσκειν χρόνῳ</span>, ‘to die
in course of time.’ A blood-curdling and unique climax of human
suffering in very truth! And this a last threat after leprosy
and madness and outcast loneliness? Surely rather a promise
of release and rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span></p>

<p>But let the anti-climax pass. Whence comes the alleged metaphorical
meaning of <span class="greek">ταριχεύεσθαι</span>, so foreign to its normal use?
How comes it to denote the wasting of disease, and what authority
has this supposed use? Its mainstay apparently is a single
passage in a pseudo-Demosthenic speech, which, in describing
the cowardly assault of a young man upon an old, depicts the
aggressor as <span class="greek">νεαλὴς καὶ πρόσφατος</span> and his victim as <span class="greek">τεταριχευμένου
καὶ πολὺν χρόνον συμπεπτωκότος</span><a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>. But here the metaphor,
whatever may be thought of its elegance or of its likelihood to
excite mirth rather than indignation, is at least clearly explained
both by its antithesis and by its context; <span class="greek">νεαλὴς</span> and <span class="greek">πρόσφατος</span>
are terms properly applied to ‘fresh’ fish or meat, <span class="greek">τεταριχευμένος</span>
to the same commodities ‘preserved’ by drying or pickling,
and we understand at once that the old man is represented to
be dried and shrivelled in appearance. Such is the support for
the alleged Aeschylean usage of <span class="greek">ταριχευθέντα</span> without the same
antithesis to illuminate its meaning. Are we then to understand
that all the fulminations and thunderings of Apollo’s oracle
dwindle away into an appeal to Orestes’ pride in his personal
appearance and a warning that leprosy will render him as unattractive
as a bloater? Or, if it be claimed that the slow painful
process of wasting is suggested rather than its ultimate effect,
is it reasonable that a word which properly denotes artificial
preservation should be used metaphorically of natural decay?
This is not metaphor, but metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Let us then abandon far-fetched explanations; let us conceive
it possible that Aeschylus used the word in the sense which it
normally bore in relation to the human body&mdash;‘preserved from
corruption,’ like the mummies of Egypt&mdash;and further that he
placed the word <span class="greek">παμφθάρτῳ</span> in immediate juxtaposition with it
in order to emphasise the more strikingly the contrast between
the threatened ‘non-corruption’ and the ordinary ‘wasting’ powers
of death. So understood, the final penalty presents a true climax.
As the victim is to be excluded in his lifetime from all intercourse
with the living, so in his death, by the withholding of that dissolution
without which there is no entrance to the lower world,
he is to be cut off from communion with the dead. He is to die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
with none to honour him with the rites due to the dead, none
to love him and shed the tears that are their just meed, but
even in that last doom which consumes all others is damned to
be withheld from corruption. As ‘Euripides the human’ uses the
common phrase of to-day ‘May the earth not receive,’ so Aeschylus
the divine anticipates the ecclesiastical formula, ‘and after death
thou shalt be indissoluble.’</p>

<p>The same contrast between the all-wasting functions of death
and the ‘bound’ condition of the damned now becomes intelligible
in two other passages of Aeschylus.</p>

<p>In the <i>Supplices</i> the king of the Pelasgians, who is beset by
the daughters of Danaus with the twofold claim of kinsfolk and
suppliants, and besought to deliver them from the lust and violence
of their pursuers, acknowledges himself in a sore strait. If he
rescue his suppliants, he may involve his people in war; if
he refuse to hearken, he fears that, as a tacit accomplice in the
violence and pollution<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> threatened, he may make to himself ‘the
God of all destruction a stern Avenger ever present, an Avenger
that sets not free the dead even in Hades’ home<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>.’</p>

<p>Again in the <i>Eumenides</i>, when Orestes having slain his mother
is no longer seeking for vengeance but flying therefrom with no
hope of safety save in the promises of Apollo whose will he has
done, the band of pursuing Furies, like to be presently thwarted
by that god, yet comfort their black hearts with the assurance
of future retribution. ‘Yea,’ cries one, ‘me doth Apollo vex, but
Orestes shall he not redeem; though he flee from me beneath
the earth, there is no freeing for him, but because of his blood-guiltiness
he shall find another in my stead to visit his pollution
on his head<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>.’</p>

<p>The conception of future punishment in these two passages
is clearly the same. What then is meant by the fear that even
the dead may not be set free? and who is ‘the God of all destruction’
who is named in the first passage as the author of that
punishment? The answer has already been found. ‘The all-destroying,
God’ (<span class="greek">ὁ πανώλεθρος θεὸς</span>) is none other than the
‘all-wasting doom’ (<span class="greek">πάμφθαρτος μόρος</span>) of Apollo’s oracle&mdash;Death
personified instead of death abstract; and Death’s refusal ‘to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
free’ the dead is to be interpreted in the light of Apollo’s warning
to Orestes that, if he fail in his duty to his murdered sire, he will
himself in death be ‘damned to incorruption.’ The language
employed is indeed vaguer and more allusive; the word <span class="greek">ἐλευθεροῦν</span>,
‘to set free,’ might suggest many ideas besides bodily
‘freeing’ or dissolution; yet it may be noticed that this is the
very word which the above-quoted<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> <i>nomocanon de excommunicatis</i>
uses interchangeably with the more common <span class="greek">λύειν</span> in this very
sense. Only for us, who have not in our hearts the same faiths
and fears quick to vibrate in response to each touch of religious
awe, is a commentary needed; for a Greek audience the suggestion
contained in <span class="greek">ἐλευθεροῦν</span>, above all in its implied contrast with
<span class="greek">πανώλεθρος</span>, fully sufficed.</p>

<p>Thus then we have found two passages of Euripides containing
imprecations almost identical in form with the curses that may
be heard from the lips of modern Greek peasants; we have found
a similar passage in Sophocles which has hitherto proved a difficulty
to commentators simply because they have tried to pervert
the meaning of the word <span class="greek">ἀποικίζω</span>, when its normal sense will
make the phrase a parallel to those of Euripides and of modern
Greece; and finally in the <i>Choephori</i> of Aeschylus&mdash;here again
by reading a word in its proper sense&mdash;we have found religious
sanction claimed for the belief which underlies these imprecations&mdash;the
belief that the fate to be most dreaded by mankind after
death is incorruptibility and resuscitation.</p>

<p>It remains to examine the supposed causes of this dreaded
fate, and to see whether the three causes which, when we discussed
the modern classes of men liable to become <i>vrykolakes</i>,
appeared to be Hellenic&mdash;namely, lack of burial, violent death,
and parental or other execration or any sin deserving it&mdash;actually
figure as causes in ancient Greek literature.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to consider the last-mentioned first.</p>

<p>An instance of formal execration has already been provided.
No better example than the curse called down by Oedipus upon
his son could be desired. But it was suggested above that in
certain other cases, even where no actual imprecation had been
uttered, men were accounted accursed; and indeed it would be
an absurdity that a son who acted undutifully towards his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
should fall a victim to his curse, but that one, let us say, who
slew his father and gave him no time to pronounce the damning
words, should go scatheless. From the earliest times, I believe,
there were held to be certain deadly sins, sins against the few
primitive god-given principles of right and wrong, which brought
their own curse. Among these was numbered from the first the
murder of a kinsman. To this Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> adds others which were
so regarded in his day. ‘Equal is the guilt when one ill treateth
the suppliant and the stranger, or goeth up unto his brother’s
bed, ... or sinneth against orphan children and heedeth not, or
chideth his old father, who hath passed the gloomy gates of age,
and raileth upon him with hard words; against such an one verily
Zeus himself is wroth, and at the end layeth upon him stern
retribution for his unrighteous deeds.’ A more civilised age
included all murder in the list; and later again the Church
seems to have extended it until ‘transgressors of the divine law’
might become <i>ipso facto</i> excommunicate and accursed.</p>

<p>To Aeschylus the chief of such sins was unquestionably the
murder of a close kinsman; but other sins also, especially those
involving pollution (<span class="greek">μίασμα</span>), rendered the perpetrator liable to
the same punishment as followed upon a formal imprecation. And
this view was not of Aeschylus’ own invention; it must have
belonged to the popular religion. Otherwise it would be impossible
to explain how the Greek Church in the Middle Ages
had come to adopt almost the same views as Aeschylus. For
what said the Church? The <i>nomocanon</i> quoted in the last
section<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> teaches that persons who ‘have been justly, reasonably,
and lawfully excommunicated by their bishops, as transgressors
of the divine law, and have died in the state of excommunication,
without amending their ways and receiving forgiveness,’
may be expected to remain whole and incorrupt after death.
But another ecclesiastical document<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> shows clearly that a formal
sentence of excommunication was not essential to this result;
a distinction is drawn between him whose corpse appears white,
showing that he was ‘excommunicated by the divine laws,’ and
him whose corpse is black, showing that he was ‘excommunicated
by a bishop.’ Clearly then the Church taught that certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
‘transgressors of the divine law’ might become automatically
excommunicate. Certain deadly sins deserved the ecclesiastical
curse and, whether it were pronounced or not, incurred the same
punishment after death. The list of such sins was certainly
extended by the Church so as to include, for example, apostasy,
omission of baptism, the more reprehensible acts of sorcery, and
suicide, which was, and still is sometimes, a bar to Christian
burial. But at the same time the number of those sins which
were actually left to work out their own curse was probably
diminished; the Church constituted herself judge, and in most
cases formally sentenced the sinner to that punishment which
the sin alone, without her condemnation, was popularly believed
to entail. If then we strip this doctrine of its ecclesiastical dress
and put out of sight the intervention of an hierarchy arrogating
to itself the office of binding and loosing, there remains the simple
belief that certain transgressors of the divine law, certain sinners
of deadly sins, were <i>ipso facto</i> accursed and condemned to incorruption.</p>

<p>Is not this precisely the Aeschylean doctrine? Pelasgus, if he
should consent unto the violence of those suitors who sought the
daughters of Danaus in unhallowed wedlock, if he should defy
Zeus the God of suppliants and set at naught those other deities
at whose altar his kinswomen sat&mdash;would not he indeed be a
transgressor of the divine law? He acknowledges it himself, and,
conformably to the doctrine enunciated, anticipates that Death
himself will turn Avenger and free him not when dead. Orestes,
owing to his murdered father the sacred duty of vengeance and
expressly urged by Apollo to perform it&mdash;would not he too be a
transgressor of the divine law, if he should fail or flag in his enterprise
of blood? Fitly then did Apollo threaten him that after
manifold troubles in life he should die damned to incorruption.
The same Orestes, viewed now not from Apollo’s standpoint but
from that of the Erinyes, bloodguilty with his mother’s murder&mdash;had
he not perpetrated a deadly sin, was he not a transgressor of
the divine law? Rightly then may his foes exult that he shall
not escape, but, though he be fled from them beneath the earth,
still ‘hath he no freeing.’ In fine, Aeschylus agrees, save for the
mediaeval multiplication of deadly sins, with the doctrine of the
Church; and this agreement is proof that in the popular creed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
Greece, from which both Aeschylus and the Church must have
borrowed, the commission of certain sins has always involved the
penalty of incorruptibility, whether the curse which those sins
merited had been formally pronounced or no. The actual source
and operation of such unspoken curses will be considered in the
next section.</p>

<p>The other two causes, lack of burial and violent death, may
be considered together; for the whole trend of ancient literature
in regard to both these calamities is the same, namely, that they
caused the return of the dead man’s spirit&mdash;of his spirit only, be
it noted, and not of his body. It is the ghost of Patroclus which
in the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> appears to Achilles and demands the funeral-rites
due to his body; it is the ghost of Elpenor which in the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
makes the same claim upon Odysseus; it is the ghost of
Polydorus which in the <i>Hecuba</i><a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> of Euripides bemoans his body
cast away in the sea. Again it is the ghost of Clytemnestra which
in the <i>Eumenides</i><a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> of Aeschylus comes seeking vengeance for her
violent death; and Lucian in the <i>Philopseudes</i><a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> gives special
prominence to this cause of the soul’s unrest. ‘Perhaps, Eucrates,’
says one of the speakers in the dialogue, ‘what Tychiades means is
this, that the only souls which wander about are those of men who
met with a violent death&mdash;anyone, for example, who hanged himself,
or was beheaded or impaled, or departed this life in any other
such way&mdash;but that the souls of those who died a natural death
do not wander; if that is his theory, it cannot be lightly dismissed.’
It is needless to multiply examples<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>; literary tradition, from Homer
down to Lucian, is all in favour of the re-appearance of the soul,
and not of the body, as the result of either lack of burial or violent
death.</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear then that there is a considerable discrepancy
between the ancient literary view and the modern
popular creed. Ancient literature is extremely reticent on the
subject of bodily resuscitation occasioned solely by a violent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
death<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> or by lack of burial. In Phlegon’s story it is indeed
probable that the cause of Philinnion’s re-appearance was a violent
death; but the first part of the narrative is missing, and no such
statement is actually made.</p>

<p>In modern beliefs, on the contrary, there is little or no trace of
the idea that the dead return for these causes in purely spiritual
form. The very conception of ghosts is weak and indefinite among
the peasantry. I have certainly been told by peasants of cases in
which a person at the point of death has appeared, presumably in
spiritual form, to friends at a distance; and there is a fairly
common belief, seemingly derived from the Bible, that at Easter
many of the graves are opened and release for a time the spirits
of the dead. But it is a significant fact that there is not even a
name for ghosts which cannot be equally well applied to any supernatural
apparitions. The thought of them in general seems to be
nothing more definite than a vague uneasiness in the minds of
timid women and children at that hour when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">‘a faint erroneous ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glanced from the imperfect surfaces of things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flings half an image on the straining eye.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no fixed creed or tradition here. In an account of
the definite superstitions of modern Greece ghosts are a <i>quantité
négligeable</i>.</p>

<p>But, while ancient literature and modern superstition are thus
in direct conflict on one point, they are agreed in making lack of
burial and violent death the causes of a certain unrest on the part
of the dead; and though the one usually attributes that unrest to
the ghost, and the other to the corpse, their agreement in all else
could not surely be a mere casual coincidence; there must be a
connexion to be discovered between them.</p>

<p>The consistency of the popular view which has obtained practically
throughout the Christian era has already been established.
The Church found the Greek people already firmly convinced that
the two causes which we are considering, no less than formal
execration or execrable sin, led to bodily incorruption and resuscitation.
The only moot point is what agency was held to
produce the resuscitation before the Church taught that it was
the work of the Devil. But can equal consistency be claimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
for ancient literature? It has just now been shown that the
tragedians recognised that a curse or a deadly sin led to the
resuscitation of the body; and yet they make lack of burial and
violent death lead rather to the re-appearance of a ghost. Why
then this discrimination between the effects produced by causes
all of which in more recent popular belief produce the same effect?
My answer is that popular belief in antiquity was the same as
popular belief now in respect of all the causes, but that literary
propriety forbade more than a mere verbal reference to so gross
a superstition as bodily resuscitation. When a dead man was
required in literature to re-appear, he was conventionally pourtrayed
as a ghost, not as a walking corpse; and the convention
was, I think, right and necessary.</p>

<p>For let it be granted for a moment that the popular belief of
to-day dates from the earliest times, and that then as now the
<i>revenant</i> was popularly pictured as a monster ‘swollen and distended
all over so that the joints can scarcely be bent; the skin
being stretched like the parchment of a drum, and when struck
giving out the same sound.’ Could even Homer have re-animated
the dead Patroclus, with this unearthly ghastliness added to his
wounds and to his mangling by the chariot, and have brought him
to Achilles in the darkness of the night, without exciting in his
breast horror instead of pity and loathing for love? Euripides
again was greatly daring when he assigned the prologue of a
tragedy to Polydorus’ ghost; but even he could not have restrained
the unquenchable mirth of his audience, if his play had opened
with a soliloquy by an agitated corpse. Epic and dramatic
propriety must have demanded some refinement of so grossly
material a conception. The canons of drama, we know, would not
allow the enactment of a murder on the stage before the eyes of
the spectators; would it then have been compatible with the
restraint of Greek art to represent the murdered body as a
<i>revenant</i>? Aeschylus himself, the lover of weird misbegotten
shapes, would have recoiled from such an enterprise. But those
same canons did permit a verbal description of the murder; and
similarly the tragedians permitted themselves to refer, in imprecations
and suchlike, to the horror of bodily resuscitation.</p>

<p>The case then stands thus. References are, as we have seen,
made by the tragedians to the possibility of men becoming <i>revenants</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>
whereas they shrank from presenting the actuality. But the
references to the possibility occur, chiefly at any rate, in imprecations,
with the result that at first sight a curse would seem to
have been the only recognised cause of bodily resuscitation in
ancient times; whereas the most famous literary examples of the
actual re-appearance of the dead&mdash;Clytemnestra and Polydorus in
tragedy, or, if we go back to Homer, Patroclus and Elpenor&mdash;happen
to be cases in which the cause was lack of burial or a violent
death, with the result that literary tradition inclined to substitute
ghosts for the corporeal <i>revenants</i> of the popular creed in these
two cases.</p>

<p>Such is my explanation of the discrepancy; and the probability
of it is warranted by three considerations&mdash;first, that Greek Tragedy
does contain one or two references to the possible resuscitation of
other than the accursed&mdash;second, that Plato modifies the popular
notions concerning the accursed in almost the same way that the
tragedians modified the fate of the unburied and of those slain by
violence&mdash;third, that the literary tradition concerning ghosts is
in itself inconsistent and bears the marks of arbitrary modification.</p>

<p>The most important reference in Tragedy occurs in the
<i>Choephori</i>, where Orestes and Electra pray their murdered father
to rise from the grave in bodily form<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>. This passage, together
with a close parallel from Sophocles, will be fully discussed later<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a>.
Here I need only point out the justification by Aeschylus of my
theory that the substitution of ghost for <i>revenant</i> is a necessary
literary convention. He suggests verbally the possible uprising of
the murdered Agamemnon as a <i>revenant</i>; but, when it comes to
an actual presentation of the murdered Clytemnestra on the stage,
his <i>dramatis persona</i> is a ghost.</p>

<p>Next, Plato, in a well-known passage of the <i>Phaedo</i><a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>, speaks of
the souls of dead men having actually been seen in the form of
shadowy apparitions haunting the neighbourhood of tombs&mdash;souls,
he explains, which have not been fully cleansed and freed from the
visible material world, but still have some part therein and hence
are themselves visible; and, he adds, these are the souls of the
wicked, which are compelled to wander thus in punishment for
their former evil life. Naturally Plato of all men&mdash;and of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
his works in the <i>Phaedo</i>&mdash;could not accept the notion that the
body under any conditions remained incorruptible; his whole
doctrine is imbued with his belief that the gross and material
perishes, and only the pure and spiritual endures. When therefore
he came to utilise the popular doctrine, which the tragedians had
endorsed, that certain sinners were condemned to incorruption,
some modification of the idea was necessary; and accordingly he
makes the wicked to wander as ghosts, not as corporeal <i>revenants</i>,
just as Homer and the tragedians seem to have done in the case
of the unburied and those who had met their death by violence.
Plato’s extension of the literary tradition suggests that its earlier
development had been such as I have indicated.</p>

<p>Lastly, the literary tradition, as represented by earlier writers
than Plato, is by no means uniform. If it had been a definite
religious doctrine, and not merely a literary convention, that the
unburied returned as ghosts, the presentment of Patroclus and of
Polydorus should have been in all respects similar. But what do
we find? Each certainly appears as a ghost and asks for burial;
but there the resemblance ends. According to Homer<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> the spirit
of Patroclus, in craving burial of his body, declares that, ere that
rite be performed, the spirit itself cannot pass the gates of Hades
but is held aloof by the spirits of the other dead, and moreover
that having once passed it can no more return to this world.
According to Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a>, familiar though he must have been with
Homer’s teaching, the spirit of Polydorus had passed within the
gates of Hades and by permission of the nether gods had returned
to demand the burial of his body. Homer’s reason for the soul’s
anxiety about the body’s burial is none too convincing in itself;
for it only raises a further question: if death means the final
separation of soul from body, and the lower world is tenanted by
souls only&mdash;for so Homer at any rate teaches&mdash;why should the
denizens of that world make the admission of a newly-sped soul
conditional upon the burial of the body which it had finally
quitted? But, what is more important, Homer’s reason, such as
it is, is flatly disavowed by Euripides, who yet advances no reason
of his own why the spirit of Polydorus, having once passed into
Hades’ halls, should have any further interest in its old carnal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>
tenement. This disagreement can only mean that Homer and
Euripides were not following an acknowledged doctrine of popular
religion in representing Patroclus and Polydorus in the form of
ghosts; for in that case they would surely have agreed with the
popular doctrine, and therefore also with each other, in assigning
a reason for the ghost’s interest in the burial of its discarded body.
Either then there was no popular belief on the whole subject&mdash;which
is incredible&mdash;or else it was such as literary propriety
forbade them to follow. Now if the popular belief was that the
unburied appeared as corporeal <i>revenants</i>, their eagerness for burial
is intelligible; but if a ghost be substituted by literary convention
for the <i>revenant</i>, a good reason for such eagerness becomes hard to
find. Hence the inconsequence of Homer’s reason; hence the
silence of Euripides.</p>

<p>But if, as now seems likely, the substitution of mere ghost for
bodily <i>revenant</i> was a literary convention, it by no means follows
that that convention is valueless as a guide to the popular beliefs
of the time. It may represent a part of those beliefs, though not
the whole. The established doctrines on this whole subject were
not remodelled by the tragedians save in obedience to the laws of
their art. This we definitely know; for the causes which they
assign for the unrest of the dead are numbered among the
popularly received causes which remain to this day; and even
the idea of physical resuscitation was retained and effectively
utilised by them within certain limitations. Clearly then they
kept what they could, and only changed what they must. Judicious
selection rather than arbitrary invention was the method by which
the literary tradition was established. Since then that tradition
uniformly speaks of the soul’s return, while discrepancies only arise
in accounting for the soul’s interest in the corpse, was it perhaps
only in the latter respect that literary tradition parted company
with popular belief? Did the spirit as well as the body of the
dead play some part in the popular superstition? Did the common-folk
too hold that, after the separation of soul from body at death,
the soul itself under certain conditions returned from its flight
towards the house of Hades&mdash;returned however not to appear
alone in ghostly guise, but to re-animate the dead body and raise
it up as a <i>revenant</i>? Was this the popular doctrine from which
literature selected, recording the soul’s return, but suppressing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>
re-animation of the body, and thereby creating for itself the difficulty
of explaining the soul’s interest in the body?</p>

<p>The hypothesis commends itself as providing at the same time
an answer to the one question which remained unanswered in
the last section. We saw that, through ecclesiastical influence,
Christian Greece has long assigned the work of resuscitating the
dead to the Devil. But to whom or to what did pagan Greece
previously assign it? Surely in the whole range of Greek mythology
it were hard to find any supernatural being either specially
suited or probably condemned to such a task. The soul is, <i>prima
facie</i>, the most appropriate and likely agent.</p>

<p>But there is even stronger evidence than this. The probable
becomes proven when we turn back to the only full pagan account
of a bodily <i>revenant</i>, the story of Philinnion. What are her words,
when she is discovered by her parents? ‘Mother and father, it
was wrong of you to grudge me three days with this man here
in my own home and doing no harm. And so, because of your
meddlesomeness, you shall mourn for me anew, and I shall go
away to my appointed place. For it is by divine consent that
I have done thus.’ And how is her threat of going away fulfilled?
‘Scarce had she spoken when she became a corpse, and her body
lay stretched upon the bed in the sight of all.’ The words ‘I shall
go away’ were therefore intended by the writer to mean ‘My soul
will go away’; for the body remained. Clearly then, in the belief
of that age, resuscitation of the dead meant the re-animation of the
body by the soul which had been temporarily separated from it.</p>

<p>In the light of this fact Plato’s reference to the wandering of
the souls of the wicked is found to approximate more nearly to the
popular superstition. Such souls, he says, have been seen in the
neighbourhood of tombs; and they are visible because they are
not cleansed and freed from the visible and material world<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a>, but
participate therein. What then is the particular material thing
in which they participate and which keeps them near the tombs?
Evidently the body whose impurities they contracted in life, the
body from which they are not cleansed and freed. Plato admits
only participation, not re-animation; but in all else he adheres to
the genuine popular belief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span></p>
<p>The same idea furnishes also what I believe to be the true
explanation of the custom of the so-called ‘Charon’s obol.’ The
coin or other object placed in the mouth of the dead was originally,
I have argued<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>, a charm to prevent the entry of some evil spirit or
the re-entry of the soul into the corpse. In Chios and in Rhodes,
as we have seen, this is the popular explanation still given&mdash;the
particular spirit against whom the precaution is taken being, owing
to Christian influence, a devil. But if, as is likely, a devil has
merely been substituted for the soul, while the rest of the superstition
has remained unchanged, it follows that the precaution was
originally directed against the return of the soul, and so was a
means of ensuring bodily dissolution; for, though I cannot actually
prove it, it is natural to suppose that re-animation was not the
result, but the cause, of incorruption.</p>

<p>To sum up, the conclusions which have been reached stand
thus:&mdash;Death, according to the popular religion of ancient Greece,
was not a final separation of body and soul; in certain cases the
body remained incorrupt and the soul re-animated it. This condition,
in which the dead belonged neither to this nor to the
nether world, was one of misery; and bodily dissolution was to be
desired. Dissolution could in no case be properly effected without
the rite of interment or cremation. The unburied therefore formed
one class of <i>revenants</i>. But even due interment did not necessarily
produce dissolution; a sudden or violent death rendered the body
incorruptible, presumably because the proper hour had not yet
come for the soul to leave it; an imprecation withheld the body
from decay by its own ‘binding’ power; and finally, the commission
of a deadly sin, above all of murder, rendered the sinner subject
to the same dire fate as if the curse which his sin merited had
actually been pronounced. The only unfailing method of dissolution
was cremation.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">§ 4. <span class="smcap">Revenants as Avengers of Blood.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The conclusions which have now been reached show, among
others, the somewhat surprising result, that the popular religion
of Greece both ancient and modern has always comprised the
belief that both the murdered and the murderer were doomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>
the same unhappy lot after death. The murderer, in the class of
men polluted and accursed by heinous sin, and his victim, in the
class of those who have met with violent deaths, have alike been
regarded as pre-disposed to become <i>revenants</i>. The two facts thus
simply stated constitute a problem which deserves investigation.
It can be no accident that two classes of men, so glaringly contrasted
here, should be believed to share the same fate hereafter.
Some relation between the two beliefs must surely subsist.</p>

<p>The solution to which the mind naturally leaps is the idea
that in some way retributive justice causes the murderer to be
punished with the selfsame suffering as he has brought upon
his victim; that, as blood calls for blood, so the resuscitation of
the murdered calls for the resuscitation of the murderer; that the
old law, <span class="greek">δράσαντι παθεῖν</span>, ‘as a man hath wrought, so must he
suffer,’ is not limited to this world nor fully vindicated by the mere
shedding of the murderer’s blood, but dooms him to become, like
his victim, a <i>revenant</i> from the grave.</p>

<p>Such an explanation of the two facts before us is, it may almost
be said, obviously and self-evidently right, so far as it goes; but
the proof of its correctness is best to be obtained by going further,
so as not merely to indicate the appropriateness of the murderer’s
punishment, but to discover also the agency whereby it is inflicted;
for, if it can be established that according to the popular belief
it is the murdered man himself who, in the form of a <i>revenant</i>,
plagues his murderer, then the retributive character of all the
murderer’s sufferings both here and hereafter will be manifest.</p>

<p>The most striking testimony to the existence of such a belief
is to be found in a gruesome practice to which, we are told,
murderers in old time were addicted&mdash;the practice of mutilating
(<span class="greek">μασχαλίζειν</span>) the murdered man by cutting off his hands and
feet, and either placing them under his armpits or tying them
with a band (<span class="greek">μασχαλιστήρ</span>) round his breast. What object
was had in view in so disposing of the severed extremities, if
indeed our information as to the act itself be correct, remains uncertain;
perhaps indeed that information amounts to nothing
more than a faulty conjectural interpretation of the word
<span class="greek">μασχαλίζειν</span> itself, which might equally well mean to sever the
arms from the body at the armpit and to treat the lower limbs in
similar fashion. But at any rate the intention of the whole act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>
of mutilation is known and clear; the murderer sought to deprive
his victim of the power to exact vengeance for his wrongs. Clearly
then the vengeance apprehended was not that of a disembodied
spirit entreating the gods to act on its behalf or appearing in
visions to its surviving kinsfolk and urging them to requite the
murderer, but the vengeance of a bodily <i>revenant</i> with feet swift
to pursue and hands strong to strike. On no other grounds is the
mutilation of the dead body intelligible.</p>

<p>But if any doubt could still rest upon this interpretation of the
old custom, it must be finally dispersed by a consideration of the one
instance of the same custom known to me in modern times. This
occurs in a story which I have already related<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>&mdash;the story of a
human sacrifice in Santorini at the time of the Greek War of
Independence, as narrated to me by an old man of the island who
claimed to have himself taken part in the affair. According to
his narrative not only the head of the victim was cut off but also
his hands, and in that order. Why then this mutilation of the
dead body? That question I put in vain to the old man; he had
obliged me by giving me his reminiscences, but he had no intention
of letting himself be cross-questioned upon them. Yet the real
answer is not hard to conjecture. Santorini is the most famous
haunt of <i>vrykolakes</i> in the whole of Greece, and familiarity with
them has bred in the minds of the islanders no contempt for them,
but rather a more lively terror. Nowhere therefore is any expedient
for combating the powers of the <i>vrykolakas</i> more likely to
be remembered and adopted. Since then the human victim in
the story is not represented as a willing victim, but was evidently
seized and slain by violence, his slayers, in performing their task,
must have recognised that he would in all probability turn <i>vrykolakas</i>,
and in their mutilation of his corpse (a deed inexpressibly
repugnant to Greek feeling now as in old time) can only have
been actuated by the hope of thus incapacitating the <i>revenant</i> for
his otherwise sure and terrible vengeance.</p>

<p>The reason then why the murderer as well as the murdered
becomes a <i>revenant</i> is plain. The victim, rising from his grave in
bodily substance, pursues his enemy with untiring rancour until
he brings him to the same sorry state as that to which he himself
has come.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span></p>
<p>Such, I venture to say, has been the conviction deep down in
the hearts of the Greek people from the earliest times down to this
day. A custom, which consists in a deliberate and sacrilegious act
of mutilation, more ghastly than murder itself, perpetrated upon the
helpless dead, and which yet has continued unchanged throughout
the changes and chances which the Greek people have undergone
for more than a score of centuries, can only be based upon the
most immutable of superstitious beliefs and dreads, and reveals
more unerringly than even the whole literature of Greece the
fundamental ideas of the Greek people concerning the avenging
of blood. The murdered man in bodily shape avenges his own
wrongs.</p>

<p>But while the existence of this belief is thus established by
the best evidence of all, namely the fact that men have continued
to act upon it, the views of ancient writers on the subject of blood-guilt
are not on that account to be neglected; on the contrary, the
whole literature bearing thereupon, and above all the story of the
house of Atreus as told by Aeschylus, much as they have been
studied, deserve fresh consideration just for the very reason that
our judgement of them must be modified by this new fact. Starting
with the knowledge of the part which the murdered man himself
played according to popular belief in securing the punishment of
his murderer, we are enabled more fully to appreciate the genius
of Aeschylus in so handling a superstition which, like other things
primitive in Greek religion, was still venerated by an age which
could discern its grossness, that, without either losing the religious
sympathies of his audience by too wide a departure from venerable
traditions, or offending their artistic taste by too close an adherence
to primitive crudities, he wrought out of that material the
fabric of the greatest of tragedies.</p>

<p>What we shall find in thus studying anew some of the
literature of the subject is a modification of the grosser elements
in the popular superstition such as the last section has already
prepared us to expect. We saw there how restricted was the use
which the tragedians and others dared to make of the popular
belief in corporeal <i>revenants</i> of any kind; we saw that dramatic
propriety absolutely forbade the introduction of a dead man to
play a part otherwise than in the form of a ghost; and yet more
than once we found, especially as the climax of some impreca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>tion,
a verbal allusion to the belief in incorruptibility and bodily
resuscitation. And now similarly we shall see that the tragedians
allowed themselves no greater license in dealing with <i>revenants</i> in
quest of vengeance than in dealing with the more innocuous sort;
we shall see that dramatic propriety forced them to find some
other agency than that of the bodily <i>revenant</i> whereby the
vengeance of Agamemnon upon Clytemnestra, and of Clytemnestra
upon Orestes, might be executed; but we shall find withal that
here again there are a few verbal references to the uprising of the
dead themselves as avengers of their own wrongs, and moreover
that, though in the actual development of the plot they can have
no part save only that of a ghost, and some other avenger is
made to act on their behalf, yet it is they themselves who
instigate and urge him to his task. The bodily activity of the
murdered man is suppressed, save for some few hints, as a thing
too gross for representation by tragic art; but at the same time
fidelity to old religious tradition is in a way maintained by proclaiming
his personal, though ghostly, activity in inciting and even
compelling others to avenge him.</p>

<p>The clearest references to the bodily activity of the murdered
man occur in precisely the same connexion in both Aeschylus and
Sophocles&mdash;in a prayer offered by Agamemnon’s children at their
dead father’s tomb. In Sophocles the occasion is that scene in
which Electra rebukes her sister for bearing Clytemnestra’s peace-offerings
to Agamemnon’s tomb&mdash;peace-offerings, be it noted,
which in themselves imply that the dead man is still a powerful
foe to his murderess&mdash;and bids her instead thereof join with
Electra herself in laying a lock of hair upon the tomb; and then
come the notable lines,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">αἰτοῦ δὲ προσπίτνουσα, γῆθεν εὐμενῆ</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘and falling at his tomb beseech thou him to come from out the
earth in his own strength a kindly helper unto us against his foes.’
No one, I suppose, can misdoubt the emphasis which falls on
<span class="greek">αὐτὸν</span>, ‘his very self’; and to the Greek mind the ‘very self’ was
not a disembodied spirit, but a thing of flesh and bones and solid
substance. Unless Sophocles was hinting verbally at that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
he durst not represent dramatically&mdash;the resurrection of the dead
man in bodily substance as an avenger of his own wrongs&mdash;the
word could have had no meaning for his hearers.</p>

<p>The parallel passage in Aeschylus comes from the prayer of
Orestes and Electra beside their father’s grave<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>. ‘O Earth,’ cries
Orestes, ‘send up, I pray thee, my father to watch o’er my fight’;
and Electra makes response, ‘O Persephone, grant thou him still
his body’s strength unmarred,’</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="greek">ὦ Περσέφασσα, δὸς δ’ ἔτ’ εὔμορφον κράτος</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been customary among translators and commentators
to render <span class="greek">εὔμορφον</span> as if the second half of the compound were
negligible; yet I can find no instance in which the word denotes
anything but beauty of bodily shape. Let Aeschylus’ own usage
of it elsewhere be the index of his meaning here. The Chorus of
the <i>Agamemnon</i>, musing on the fate of those who have fallen at
Ilium, tell how in place of some there have been sent home to
their kin mere parcels of ashes, ‘while others, about the walls
where they fell, possess sepulchres of Trojan soil, in comeliness of
shape unmarred’&mdash;<span class="greek">οἱ δ’ αὐτοῦ περὶ τεῖχος θηκὰς Ἰλιάδος γᾶς
εὔμορφοι κατέχουσιν</span><a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>. My rendering then of <span class="greek">εὔμορφον κράτος</span>
is right and cannot be evaded. Aeschylus, like Sophocles in the
preceding passage, lightly yet surely, by the use of a single word,
hints at the popular belief that the murdered man may rise again
in bodily form to wreak his own vengeance.</p>

<p>Once again then the tragedians have come to our aid in the
unravelling of this superstition. From them we learnt that incorruptibility
and resuscitation were as great a terror to their
contemporaries as they are to the modern peasants of Greece, and
that actually the same imprecations of that calamity were in vogue
then as at this day; and now again we receive from them corroboration
of that which the horrible practice of mutilating a murdered
man’s corpse had already revealed, namely, that some of the dead
who returned from their graves were believed to go to and fro, not
in mere vain and pitiable wanderings, but with the fell purpose of
revenging themselves upon their murderers.</p>

<p>The general tendency however of Greek literature, as we saw
in the last section, was to replace the bodily <i>revenant</i> by a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
ghost. In many cases the consequences of this literary modification
were comparatively small; the ghost of Polydorus for example
can sustain the part of pleading plaintively for burial no less
effectively, perhaps indeed even more so, than a lusty <i>revenant</i>.
But the case of <i>revenants</i> bent upon vengeance was different; the
consequences of substituting a mere spirit were far-reaching; the
part to be played consisted not in piteous words but in stern
work; and for this part so frail and flimsy a creature as the
Greeks pictured the ghost to be was absolutely unfitted. The
only means of escaping from this difficulty was to represent the
dead man as employing some instrument or agent of retribution;
and accordingly, where the gross popular superstition would have
had the murdered man emerge from his grave in bodily form to
chase and to slay his murderer, literature in general confined the
dead man to the unseen world and allowed him only to work by
less directly personal means&mdash;sometimes by the hands of his next
of kin, in other cases by a curse either automatically operative or
executed by demonic agents. But it is important to observe that,
whatever the means employed, literature cleaves to the old traditions,
so far as artistic taste permits, by conceding to the
murdered man the power of instigating the agents and controlling
the instruments of his vengeance. His power is made spiritual
instead of physical; but his personal activity is still recognised;
he remains the prime avenger of his own wrongs.</p>

<p>These indirect methods of retribution must now be examined
severally.</p>

<p>As regards the part taken by the next of kin to the murdered
man in furthering the work of vengeance, I find no reason to
suppose that literature deviated in any way from popular tradition.
The idea of the vendetta is essentially primitive and at the same
time perfectly harmonious with the belief that the murdered man
is capable of executing his own revenge. The acknowledged
power of the dead man has never in the minds of the Greek
people served as an excuse for his kinsmen to sit idle; rather it
has been an incentive to them to assist more strenuously in the
task of vengeance, lest they themselves also should fall under the
dead man’s displeasure. On this point ancient lore and modern
lore are completely agreed.</p>

<p>The best exponents of this view at the present day are a people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span>
who can claim to be the most distinctively Hellenic inhabitants of
the Greek mainland. The peninsula which terminates in the
headland of Taenarum is the home of a race which is historically
known to be of more purely Greek descent than the inhabitants
of any other district, and which both in physical type and in
social and religious customs stands apart&mdash;the Maniotes. Among
their customs is the vendetta, and the beliefs on which it rests are
in brief as follows. A man who has been murdered cannot rest in
his grave until he has been avenged, but issues forth as a <i>vrykolakas</i>
athirst for his enemy’s blood; for, in Maina, one who has
turned <i>vrykolakas</i> for this cause is still credited with some
measure of reasonableness. To secure his bodily dissolution and
repose, it is incumbent upon the next of kin to slay the murderer
or, at the least, some near kinsman of the murderer. Until that
be done, the son (to take the most common instance) lies under
his dead father’s curse; and, if he be so craven or so unfortunate
as to find no opportunity for vengeance, the curse under which he
has lived clings to him still in death, and he too becomes a
<i>vrykolakas</i>.</p>

<p>The Maniote doctrine then amounts to this, that the murdered
man rises from his grave to execute his own vengeance, which
consists in bringing upon his murderer the same fate as he
himself has suffered through his enemy’s deed&mdash;a violent death
and consequently resuscitation; but at the same time he demands
the assistance of his nearest kinsman, under pain of suffering
a like fate hereafter if his efforts in the cause of vengeance are
feeble or fruitless. Thus the belief in powerful and vindictive
<i>revenants</i> forms the very mainspring of the vendetta.</p>

<p>To this view both Euripides and Aeschylus subscribe in telling
the story of Orestes. In the former we have the answer made by
Orestes himself to the tirade of Tyndareus<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> against the vendetta:
‘Nay, if by silence,’ he says, ‘I had consented unto my mother’s
deeds, what would my dead sire have done to me? Would he
not have hated me and made me the sport of Furies? Hath my
mother these goddesses at her side to help her cause, and hath
not he that was more despitefully used?’<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Surely no clearer
statement could be made of Orestes’ apprehension that, if he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
fail in the duty which his dead father imposed upon him, the dead
man would turn other ministers of his vengeance upon his cowardly
son, to plague him, as if he were an accomplice, with the same
punishment as had been designed for the actual author of the
murder. And similarly in Aeschylus we have the retort of Orestes
to his mother’s last warning before he slays her. ‘Beware,’ she
says, ‘the fiends thy mother’s wrath shall rouse’; and he answers,
‘But, an I flag, how should I ’scape my sire’s?’<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> Thus according
to the ancient tragedians the vendetta of Orestes was prompted
by the same beliefs and fears as still stir the Maniotes thereto.</p>

<p>So far then as concerns the vengeance for Agamemnon’s death,
ancient drama added no new element to the popular beliefs, but
was able to satisfy the requirements of art by judicious selection
from them. The idea, to which the Maniotes still cling, that the
murdered man in the form of a <i>revenant</i> avenges his own wrongs,
is, save for the rare verbal allusions which we have noticed,
rejected, and forms no part of the plot; but the belief, that fear of
the dead man’s wrath is a cogent motive to action on the part of
his kinsman, is retained. And here it is interesting to observe
that Aeschylus even justifies his rejection of the first half of the
popular doctrine, and that too by a plea perfectly satisfactory to
the popular mind. Agamemnon’s case was peculiar. Not only
had he been murdered, but his dead body according to Aeschylus,
who is followed in this by Sophocles<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>, had been mutilated (<span class="greek">ἐμασχαλίσθη</span>)
by his murderers. The effect of such mutilation, as
we have seen, was to render the <i>revenant</i> powerless to wreak
vengeance with his own hands. Hence the work devolving upon
Orestes would have been, in popular esteem, doubled; if murder
alone had been committed, he would have worked in conjunction,
as it were, with the dead man; but the super-added mutilation
incapacitated the dead man for bodily work, and placed the whole
burden of retribution on the shoulders of his son. This, plainly
put, is the meaning of the words spoken by the Chorus in the
<i>Choephori</i> to Orestes: ‘Yea, and he was mutilated, for thou must
know the worst. Cruel was she in the slaying of him, cruel still
in the burial, in that she thought to make his doom a burden past
bearing upon thy life<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>.’ Thus it may be claimed that Aeschylus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>
in the peculiar conditions of the case which he here presents,
follows unswervingly the popular doctrine. It is only Euripides
who can fairly be said to have really suppressed anything in this
part of the story without troubling to justify himself by the
circumstances of Agamemnon’s fate. But even Euripides, though
he simply ignores in his plot the possibility of Agamemnon’s
bodily resuscitation, is faithful to the doctrine that the next of kin
was actuated in seeking vengeance not by simple piety but by
a lively fear of the dead man’s wrath.</p>

<p>Moreover, this conception of the relations subsisting between
the murdered man and his nearest kinsman did not merely furnish
the <i>motif</i> of some fine passages of Tragedy; it served also a more
prosaic purpose, and actually formed the basis first of Attic law
concerning blood-guilt, and then of Plato’s Laws in the same
connexion.</p>

<p>At Athens, as is well known, the duty of prosecuting a
murderer (or homicide) was imposed by law upon the nearest
relative of the murdered man. But the obligation was not only
legal; it was also, and indeed primarily, religious. The law did no
more than affirm and regulate a custom which religious tradition
had long established. To this fact Antiphon especially bears
witness in certain passages<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> with which I must deal more fully
later; but the whole tenor of his appeals to the religious feelings
and fears of the jury is strictly in accord with the Maniote doctrine
of the present day, save that in one small point he takes a more
merciful view. In Maina it is held that, if the next of kin fail to
avenge the dead man, no matter to what cause the failure be due,
he falls a prey to the dead man’s wrath. Antiphon on the contrary
asserts that, if the next of kin have honestly done his best to bring
the murderer to justice, he will not be punished for failure therein;
and yet he does not represent the dead man as inactive in such
a case, but dares to threaten the jury that the murdered man’s
anger will now descend, not upon his kinsman who has loyally
striven to avenge him, but upon the jury who, by unjustly acquitting
and harbouring<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> the murderer, make themselves accomplices
in his crime and sharers in his pollution. This difference
of opinion however is of minor importance, and seems to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>
almost a necessary result of different social conditions. In ancient
Athens the next of kin was required to proceed against the
murderer by legal means, and not to commit a breach of law and
order by personal violence. In modern Maina the kinsman who
should have recourse to law and call in the police would be
accounted a recreant; public opinion requires him to find an
opportunity, openly or by ambush, of slaying the murderer with
his own hand; this is to be his life’s work, if need be, and the
possibility of failure, save through want of enterprise and energy,
is hardly contemplated. But as regards the main issue, namely
the belief that the dead man himself is the prime avenger of his
own wrongs and that his kinsman acts only under his instigation
as an assistant in the work, modern superstition has the entire
support both of the drama and of the law of ancient Athens.</p>

<p>Further corroboration is perhaps unnecessary; yet Plato’s
legislation in the matter of homicide must not be passed over; for
it possesses this peculiar interest and importance of its own, that
it was confessedly based upon a religious doctrine which Plato
esteemed ‘old even among the traditions of antiquity<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>.’ From
what source he obtained the doctrine he does not definitely say;
but, from a mention of Delphi in the passage immediately preceding
as the supreme authority in all matters of purification
from blood-guilt, it may fairly be surmised that this too is a piece
of Delphic lore. At any rate Plato accepted it as an authoritative
pronouncement to which the homicide must pay due heed.</p>

<p>‘The doctrine,’ says Plato, ‘is that one who has lived his life
in the spirit of a free man and meets with a violent death is
wroth, while his death is yet recent, against the man who caused
it, and when he sees him going his way in the places where he
himself was wont to move, he strikes<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> him with the same quaking
and terror with which he himself has been filled by the violence
done to him, and in his own confusion confounds his enemy and
all his doings to the utmost of his power, aided therein by the
slayer’s own conscience. And that is why it is right that the
doer of the deed should in deference to the sufferer withdraw
for the full space of the year, and should keep clear of the whole
country which the dead man had frequented as his native land;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
and if the dead man be a foreigner the slayer must hold aloof
from the foreigner’s country for the same period. Such then is
the law; and, if a man voluntarily observe it, the dead man’s
nearest kinsman, whose duty it is to look to all this, must respect
the slayer, and will do right to be at peace with him; but, if the
slayer disregard this law and either presume to enter holy places
and to sacrifice before he be purified, or, again, refuse to fulfil the
allotted period in retirement, the nearest of kin must proceed
against him on a charge of homicide, and, if a conviction be
obtained, the penalties are to be doubled. But if the nearest of
kin do not seek vengeance for the deed, it is held that the pollution
devolves upon him, and that the sufferer (i.e. the dead man)
turns upon him the suffering (i.e. that which the homicide himself
should have incurred), and anyone who will may bring a suit
against him and obtain a sentence of banishment for five years<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>.’</p>

<p>Now for a right appreciation of this passage it must be borne
in mind that Plato introduces his old tradition <i>à propos</i> of unintentional
homicide. The actual penalties therefore are of a
milder nature than those with which we have hitherto been
concerned. Indeed it is not the difference in the penalties which
should cause any surprise, but rather that an unintentional act
should be punished at all; and it would seem perhaps that in
citing this doctrine Plato sought to justify himself in retaining
a provision of Attic law which at first sight appeared unjust. In
Athens<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>, we know, the involuntary homicide was required not only
to undergo purification but to withdraw for a whole year from the
country of the man whom he had slain. The hardship of this was
manifest, and yet Plato acquiesced in the righteousness of it for
the reason apparently that the year’s retirement<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> was not a penalty
imposed by the state, but a satisfaction which, according to
religious tradition, the dead man demanded and might even
himself enforce.</p>

<p>Plato in fact recognises no less frankly than others the personal
activity of the slain man. He differs indeed in limiting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
duration of that activity, when he says that the dead man’s anger
is hot against the slayer only while his death is still recent, and
when by the provisions of his law he implies that the victim’s
desire for vengeance is fully satisfied by the slayer’s withdrawal
for the space of one year. But this difference is completely
explained by the fact that Plato introduces the tradition in connexion
with unintentional homicide, whereas previously we have
had it treated in relation to wilful murder. Reasonably enough
the man who has been accidentally slain is represented as angry
only for a time, while the victim of deliberate murder nourishes
a wrath implacable. The one drives the author of his misfortune
into exile for a year and then repents him of the evil; the other
dogs his enemy with vengeance not only for a year but throughout
his life and even after death; and indeed Plato himself, when he
passes from the subject of involuntary homicide to that of deliberate
murder, proves his recognition of this difference by his
enactments; for, at any rate in the most heinous case, namely the
murder of a near kinsman, he expressly states<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> that the old
principle ‘as a man hath done, so must he suffer’ admits of no
abatement; the guilty man must die, and his body be left unburied.</p>

<p>But I must not yet enter upon a discussion of the actual
punishments inflicted. Here I am only concerned to point out
how completely Plato’s ‘old doctrine’ harmonises with that which
we have learnt from other sources concerning the personal activity
of the dead man. First we read that the dead man terrifies and
confounds the slayer to the utmost of his power, with the aid of
the slayer’s own conscience; and then again that his next of kin is
under an obligation to obtain satisfaction for him, and is punished
by him if he neglects that duty. Clearly the slayer’s own
conscience is no more than an instrument&mdash;a somewhat ineffective
instrument, one might think, in a case of unintentional
homicide&mdash;and the next of kin is no more than a minister, both of
them employed and directed by the dead man himself. He it is
who exacts his own vengeance.</p>

<p>The other literary method of mitigating the crude popular
belief in a bodily <i>revenant</i> hunting down his enemy was to treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
the murderer’s punishment as the result of a curse. Such a curse
was denoted usually by the word <span class="greek">μήνιμα</span>, which may perhaps be
more exactly rendered by the phrase ‘a manifestation of wrath
(<span class="greek">μῆνις</span>)’ on the part of some supernatural being<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>, whether a god
or the departed spirit of a man; when once provoked by deadly
sin such as the murder of a kinsman or refusal of burial, this
curse was held to cleave to the tainted family from generation to
generation.</p>

<p>In the case of blood-guilt, which we are at present considering,
the curse, as was said above, was held either to work spontaneously
or to be executed by some powers of the nether world. The
former view is more rarely adopted, but is clearly enough indicated
in one or two passages of ancient literature. Plato in the
<i>Phaedrus</i> speaks of most grievous sicknesses and sufferings being
produced in certain families as the consequence of ancient curses
(<span class="greek">παλαιῶν ἐκ μηνιμάτων</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>; and from the reminiscences and
verbal echoes of Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i> which appear in the passage<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>
it is abundantly clear that the particular family which Plato had
in mind was the blood-guilty house of Atreus. Here then there
is no mention of any gods, no suggestion that the curse was
executed by them or in the first instance proceeded from them.
And the negative evidence of Plato’s silence concerning the gods
is turned to certainty by the positive statement of Aeschylus that,
if a son neglect the task of vengeance, ‘betwixt him and the
gods’ altars standeth the unseen barrier of his father’s wrath<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>’; for
if, in the case of the kinsman who by neglecting the duty of
vengeance has made himself a partaker in the guilt and pollution
of the murderer, the Wrath (<span class="greek">μῆνις</span>) by which he is punished both
proceeds from the dead man and, far from needing the gods’
furtherance in order to take effect, stands as it were on guard to
hold the polluted man aloof from their altars, then surely the
Wrath which pursues the murderer himself must emanate from
the same source and possess the same spontaneous efficacy. The
dead man himself then both launches the curse and controls its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
course; and probably it was in deference to this doctrine that
Plato formulated his own law, that, even in the case of a father
being killed by his own son, the dying man might with his last
breath remit the curse which such a deed incurred and exempt his
son from all except the purifications and the temporary retirement
imposed in cases of involuntary homicide<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>.</p>

<p>But more frequently the execution of the curse is conceived
to be the work of certain powers of the nether world. These
powers however do not act on their own initiative; they are
instigated to the task of vengeance by the murdered man himself.
Here, no less than in the other renderings of the old tradition,
the sufferer himself is the supreme avenger of his own sufferings.
The most famous example of this conception is furnished by the
plot of the <i>Eumenides</i>. The Furies are represented as the
servants of Clytemnestra, faithful witnesses to her wrongs, exactors
of blood for blood on her behalf<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>. When they slumber and
allow Orestes to escape the while, her ghost approaches them in
no suppliant manner for all their godhead, but chides them and
urges them afresh, like hounds, upon the quarry’s trail<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>. And,
most significant of all, there is one passage in which they say of
themselves that the name whereby they are known in their home
beneath the earth is the name of Curses (<span class="greek">Ἀραί</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>; they are in fact
the personification of those curses which a murdered man himself
directs against his murderer. Nor is this notion confined
to drama. Xenophon is little prone to poetic imaginings; yet he
can find an argument for the immortality of the soul in what he
considers an established fact of human experience, namely, that
the spirits of those who have been unjustly slain inspire terrors
in their murderers’ hearts and ‘send against them’ certain
‘avengers of blood’ (<span class="greek">παλαμναίους ἐπιπέμπουσι</span><a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>). And elsewhere
again and again we hear of the same avengers under a variety
of names&mdash;<span class="greek">μιάστορες</span>, <span class="greek">ἀλάστορες</span>, <span class="greek">προστρόπαιοι</span>&mdash;names which
will receive consideration later and by their very meaning and
usage will confirm once more my contention that, by whatever
instrument or agency the murder is represented as being avenged,
ancient literature only departed from the primitive belief in bodily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>
<i>revenants</i> executing their own vengeance at the one point at
which the grossness of popular superstition must have offended
educated sensibilities, and followed the old tradition as faithfully
as might be in conceding to the dead man, if not bodily, yet
personal, activity.</p>

<p>The same popular beliefs, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, probably attached
also to another class of <i>revenants</i>, dead men whose bodies had not
received due burial. The necessary modifications of the superstition
would be two in number. First, the anger of the dead
man would not endure for ever, unless his body had been so treated
that burial was no longer possible, but would cease with the
performance of that which he returned to demand; and secondly,
he would not be represented as using for his agent his next of
kin, who in most cases of the kind would be the very person
responsible to him for the neglect of burial. Literature therefore
had here no choice of versions; the bodily re-appearance of the
dead man was reckoned too gross an idea; the employment of his
nearest kinsman to act on his behalf became in this case impossible;
a curse was the only expedient. And this is the
expedient which we actually find adopted. In the <i>Iliad</i> Hector
adjures Achilles not to fulfil his threat of throwing his dead body
to the dogs and to the fowls of the air, but to give him burial,
‘lest,’ he says, ‘I become a cause of the gods’ wrath against
thee’&mdash;<span class="greek">μή τοί τι θεῶν μήνιμα γένωμαι</span><a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>&mdash;and the self-same
phrase is put into the mouth of Elpenor’s spirit in the <i>Odyssey</i>
when he craves due burial of Odysseus<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>. The same idea occurs
once more in Pindar’s reference to Phrixus, who bade go unto the
halls of Aeetes (for there in a strange land he had died, and had
not received the burial-rites of his own country) and bring his
spirit to rest, and whose bidding Jason is besought by Pelias to
fulfil, for that ‘already doth old age wait upon me; but with thee
the blossom of youth is but burgeoning, and thou canst put away
the wrath of powers beneath<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>.’ In each of these passages then
the actual enforcement of the dead man’s will is by means of a
curse or ‘manifestation of wrath’&mdash;for the same word <span class="greek">μήνιμα</span> (or
<span class="greek">μῆνις</span>) is used; in each case also, as it happens, the curse does
not operate automatically but is executed by gods&mdash;the method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
preferred also, as we saw, in cases of blood-guilt; but here also, as
there, the personal activity of the dead man is frankly acknowledged;
the phrase of Homer ‘lest I become ...’ and that of
Pindar ‘Phrixus doth bid ...’ clearly suggest that the gods were
instigated to intervene by the sufferer himself.</p>

<p>The case then stands thus. We learnt in the last chapter that
the unburied dead no less than the murdered were popularly
believed to become <i>revenants</i>. We have since learnt that the
murdered, in the capacity of <i>revenants</i>, were popularly believed to
avenge their own wrongs with their own hands, but that ancient
literature commonly presents a modified version of that belief
according to which the personal activity indeed of the dead man
is recognised, but the instrument of his vengeance is a curse
executed by demonic agents. We find now that literature assigns
also to the unburied dead the same personal activity in punishing
those whose neglect has caused their suffering, and by the same
means. The reasonable inference is that here too we have a
modified version of a popular belief that the unburied, like the
murdered, not only became <i>revenants</i>, which we know, but, in the
capacity of <i>revenants</i>, themselves punished those who refused or
neglected to render them their due funeral rites.</p>

<p>Thus the same principle governed the whole system of the
punishment incurred by men who were guilty either of murder or
of leaving the dead unburied&mdash;the principle that the dead man
whom they had injured in either of these ways himself requited
those injuries. Hence, when we proceed to examine the actual
punishments inflicted, we need no longer concern ourselves with
the fact that literature attributes the infliction now to the nearest
kinsman of the dead man and anon to some divine avenger; but,
whatsoever instrument or agency is employed, we know that the
dead man himself was believed to control and direct it, and therefore
that the punishment thus effected was conceived to be such
as the dead man himself willed and, in popular belief, could with
his own hands enforce. Thus in the <i>Oresteia</i> the punishment of
Clytemnestra is actually effected by Orestes, and again the punishment
of Orestes is entrusted to the Furies; but Orestes is only
the minister of his dead father, carrying out the work of retribution
under pain of incurring the same punishment himself if by
inaction he should consent unto his mother’s crime; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>
Furies in like manner are only the servants of the dead Clytemnestra,
instigated by her to their pursuit. The slaying of
Clytemnestra and the sufferings of Orestes are the punishments
which the dead Agamemnon and the dead Clytemnestra, even in
the literary version of the story, impose, and, in a more primitive
and gross form of it, might themselves have inflicted.</p>

<p>But before examining the nature of those punishments in
detail, it will be well to recall the fact that to the eyes of the
ancient Greeks murder or homicide always presented itself in two
distinct aspects<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>. Regarded from one point of view, it was the
gravest possible injury to the man who was slain. Viewed from
the other, it was a source of ‘pollution’ (<span class="greek">μίασμα, μύσος, ἅγος</span>), an
abomination to the gods and a peril to living men; for the taint
of bloodshed was conceived as a contagious physical malady, which
the polluted person by touch or even by speech<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> might communicate
to his fellow-men, and not to them only, but to places
which he visited, the market, the harbours, the temples<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>; nay,
even the sanctity of the gods’ images was not proof against the
contamination of his bloodstained hands<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>. In brief, the two
aspects of homicide were the moral and the religious aspects;
and both moral and religious atonements were required. The
wrong done to the dead man was requited by the sufferings
which he in turn imposed; the pollution, being primarily a
state of religious disability (for it involved, as Plato says<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>, the
enmity of the gods), was removed by a religious ceremony of
purification.</p>

<p>How clearly marked was this distinction in antiquity is evident
from Plato’s laws on homicide, as a brief consideration of two
or three special cases will show.</p>

<p>First, in the most venial case of homicide, where a man had
killed his own slave, he incurred no punishment at all, but was
bound none the less to get himself purified<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, in cases of the utmost enormity, as where a man
wilfully murdered his father or mother, religion provided no
means of purification. Blood-guilt in general was ‘hard to cure’;
but parricide belonged to the class of sins ‘incurable<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>.’ Such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>
murderer therefore must die, for, as Plato says, ‘there is no other
kind of purification’ in this case than the paying of blood for
blood. Religious purification in the ordinary sense of the word
was refused, but the extreme punishment was demanded.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in the majority of cases of blood-guilt, where both
purification and punishment were required, the two were clearly
independent of each other. The purification of the involuntary
homicide was to precede the year’s retirement<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>. The religious
ceremony cleansed the man from pollution, but could no more
exempt him from making satisfaction to the dead man whom he
had wronged, than absolution of sin pronounced in the Christian
confessional can exempt from the legal consequences of crime.
The Delphic priesthood itself, if we may trust the testimony of
Aeschylus, claimed no more than the power to cleanse; for Apollo
himself, holding Orestes guilty of manslaughter though not of
murder, after granting him religious purification, does not intervene
to save him from that exile which even the unintentional homicide
was bidden by Attic law to undergo; nay, he even acquiesces
in the necessity of Orestes’ flight, bids him not faint before his
wanderings are done, and promises only to set a limit thereto and
to free him from the pursuing Furies in the end<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>.</p>

<p>The distinction between the pollution and the injury, and
between the purification and the punishment, being thus clearly
recognised, it is necessary, in investigating the relations between
the dead man and his murderer, to set the purely religious aspect
of blood-guilt on one side, and to treat the punishments inflicted
upon the murderer simply as the settling of an account between
man and man. One point only as regards the pollution need be
borne in mind, namely, that purification was granted to the homicide
in the interests of gods and men whose abodes would otherwise
be defiled by his presence, and that the dead man could not conceivably
derive any satisfaction therefrom. On the contrary, his
desire for vengeance would naturally lead him to interpose ‘the
unseen barrier of his wrath’ betwixt the guilty man and those
altars of the gods where alone purification could be won, and thus
to keep his enemy still polluted; for his pollution, just because
it was a peril to his fellowmen, carried with it the punishment of
utter solitude until he was cleansed. When therefore, as will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>
appear later, the murdered man is described not only as an
avenger of his own wrongs, but as one who strives to keep alive
the religious defilement of the murderer, there is no confusion of
the moral and the religious aspects of murder, but rather the
injured man is conceived as wreaking his vengeance by every
possible means, not only directly by the sufferings which he can
personally inflict, but also indirectly by the privation which the
state of pollution necessarily involves.</p>

<p>The nature of the direct acts of vengeance, which are now to
be examined, can best be learnt from that passage of the <i>Choephori</i>
which depicts the horrible penalties awaiting Orestes if by inaction
he should make himself a consenter to the crime of Clytemnestra.
We have already learnt that in such a case the defaulting kinsman
incurred precisely the same punishment as he should have assisted
to inflict on the actual murderer. That therefore with which
Orestes was threatened was that to which Clytemnestra was
already condemned. The punishments named are those with
which, according to popular superstition, a murdered man, risen
in bodily substance from the grave, could requite his enemy. For
no one, I suppose, would suggest that Aeschylus, who followed
popular tradition so scrupulously in all that did not absolutely
conflict with dramatic propriety, invented for himself the whole
scheme of penalties here set forth. That he was bound to modify
the means whereby the punishments were inflicted, in order to
avoid the incongruity of a <i>revenant</i> upon the stage, we already
know and shall see again; but how closely he adhered to the
popularly accepted scheme of punishments, even when he was
forced to find some new means of inflicting them, will incidentally
be shown by that detailed examination to which his list of penalties
must now be subjected.</p>

<p>The first penalty is the physical torment of leprous blains that
consume the body and age the sufferer prematurely. At first we
are inclined to wonder why leprosy is selected by the dead man
as his means of retaliation against his enemy; but a little reflection
will lead us to guess that in this particular act of
vengeance Aeschylus could not actually reproduce the popular
doctrine. The common-folk believed in the bodily activity of
the dead; and, if they believed also that bodily sufferings were
part of the punishment which the murderer incurred, the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
beliefs must surely have been correlated; the physical sufferings
of the murderer must have been conceived to be caused by the
physical activity of the murdered; or, to put it more plainly,
if we may elucidate ancient superstition by the aid of modern,
the murdered man, in the form of a <i>revenant</i> bent on vengeance,
was believed to leap upon his victim and rend him with his teeth
and suck out his very life-blood. Clearly Aeschylus could not
commit himself to so crude a presentation of a <i>revenant</i>; he could
not conjure up before his audience the spectacle of the dead
Agamemnon athirst for actual blood; but equally clearly he
knew that popular superstition, and had it in his mind when he
depicted the horrors of leprosy. For the bodily assault of a
<i>revenant</i> he substituted a natural malady engendered by a dead
man’s unseen wrath; but he described the operation of that
malady in language suggested by the popular presentment of a
personal avenger more reasonable indeed in his purpose but
scarcely less ferocious in his acts than a Slavonic vampire&mdash;‘blains
that leap upon the flesh and with savage jaws eat out its
erstwhile vigour<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>.’ The means of inflicting the punishment is
changed, but the actual punishment of the murderer is the same
as if it were not leprosy but in very truth a vampire, which leapt
upon him and gnawed his flesh and drained his life-blood. So
faithful is Aeschylus to the crude popular idea of a retribution
which required that he who had spilled another’s blood should
have his own blood drunk by his victim.</p>

<p>The second penalty is the mental agony of one whom ‘madness
and vain terror sprung of the darkness do shake and
confound<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>.’ Here again the punishment is in strict accord with
that law that a man must suffer as he has wrought. That old
tradition recorded and revered by Plato, on which I have already
touched, taught that every man who was slain by violence was
himself filled thereby with quaking and terror and confusion of
spirit, and accordingly sought his revenge in terrifying and confounding
the slayer. No clearer commentary on the lines of
Aeschylus could be desired. Plato explains how the terror and
the confusion&mdash;for he employs the selfsame words as Aeschylus&mdash;by
which the murderer is overwhelmed are the exact counterpart
of the mental anguish which his violence brought upon his victim.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
Aeschylus then once again was following closely an old tradition of
the popular religion. It matters not at all that in this case he
names the Erinyes as the agents, just as previously he made
leprosy the instrument, of the dead man’s vengeance. The actual
sufferings which the murderer must undergo are in this case also
identical in character with those which he caused to his victim.</p>

<p>The third punishment of the blood-guilty man consists in
wandering friendless and outcast; and this again is no arbitrary
invention of Aeschylus, but was clearly prescribed by that old
tradition which, in Plato’s reckoning, justified the legal imposition
of a year’s retirement even upon those who had shed blood involuntarily.
Where then is that correspondence, which our
examination of the first two penalties has led us to expect,
between this third punishment and the sufferings of the dead
man who exacts it? Is there the same nicety of retribution?
Clearly so. The dead man became in popular belief a <i>revenant</i>, a
wanderer from out the grave, pitiable in his loneliness, cut off
from all friendly intercourse with living men, not yet admitted to
the fellowship of the departed, the sorriest of outcasts. Such was
the misery to which the murderer by his act of violence had
brought his victim; such therefore too the misery which the
murderer himself must taste in his wanderings and loneliness here
on earth, though it were but a foretaste of more consummate
misery hereafter. Truly even in life the murderer was made to
suffer as he had wrought.</p>

<p>And then comes the fourth penalty, death; for though
Aeschylus, in the list of punishments which we have now before
us, touches but lightly on this, the most obvious form of retribution,
yet elsewhere he repeatedly affirms, and many another
re-echoes, the doctrine that blood cries for blood<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>. Perhaps in
this passage he felt that by depicting the gnawing pangs of
leprosy he had sufficiently proclaimed the sure approach of death;
perhaps he passed it by as a slight thing in comparison with the
horror that yet remained to be told. For death did not close the
tale of punishments; the blood-guilty man, so chant the Furies,
‘though he be dead is none too free<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>.’</p>

<p>And so we pass to the last requirement of vengeance, that the
outcast shall have no friend to honour his dead body with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span>
due funeral-rites, whereby alone the desired dissolution could be
secured, but is doomed to lie unburied, incorruptible. Such is my
interpretation of the closing lines of the passage before us; and there
is no need to repeat the defence of my contention that the word
<span class="greek">ταριχευθέντα</span> must be understood in its literal and proper sense.
But it will not be out of place to note here how, in the <i>Eumenides</i>,
Aeschylus’ mind was still pervaded by the same popular belief.
The word <span class="greek">ταριχεύεσθαι</span> means, in the literal sense in which I have
taken it, to be withheld from corruption by some process of curing
or drying; and, fantastic though it may seem, it is that process of
‘drying,’ if I may use the word, which the Furies are charged by
Clytemnestra to carry out against her murderer. Let Aeschylus’
own words prove it. Hear first how Clytemnestra’s ghost with
her last words spurs on the Furies to this special task:</p>

<p>And the Furies prove by their threats to Orestes that they are
not unmindful of their charge. ‘Nay, in return for the blood thou
hast shed, thou must give me to suck the red juices from thy

binding-spell which the Furies chant to draw him whom they

<p>Such is the wild, weird refrain of the Furies’ incantation; and in
its closing phrase are re-echoed the closing words of Clytemnestra’s
charge.</p>

<p>Will anyone then venture to say that Aeschylus had no special
reason for thus repeating thrice within the compass of some two
hundred lines the same threat? For the punishment threatened
is substantially the same, though the means of inflicting it vary.
Now it is the breath of the Furies which shall scorch up the
victim’s very blood; now it is their lips that shall suck him dry;
now a magic spell to parch and shrivel him; but ever the effect is
the same; the bloodguilty man shall lie in death a sere and
sapless carcase, already ‘damned to incorruption<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> even in that
doom which wastes all else.’ And the only reason which I can
conceive for the poet’s insistence upon this thought is that here
again, as in all the former punishments, he was reproducing a
popular belief substantially the same then as it is in Maina now,
namely, that the murdered man, having become a <i>revenant</i>, sucked
his murderer’s blood and made him also in his turn a <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>Nor is Aeschylus the only ancient authority for the idea of some
such retribution after death. Plato, in a passage of the <i>Phaedrus</i>
already cited, contemplates the activity of a murdered man’s wrath
(<span class="greek">μήνιμα</span>) not only in the present time but also hereafter<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>; and in
his <i>Laws</i> there is a provision, not assuredly of his own devising but
dating from the very beginning of Greek legislation, which can
only have been designed to insure the complete vengeance of the
murdered man on his murderer even beyond death. A man convicted
of the wilful murder of a near kinsman<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> was punishable not
only with death but with a further penalty: ‘the attendants of the
jury and the magistrates having killed him shall cast out his
corpse naked at an appointed cross-roads without the city, and
all the magistrates, representing the whole city, shall take each a
stone and cast it upon the head of the corpse and thereby free the
whole city from guilt, and thereafter they shall carry the corpse to
the borders of their land and cast it out, in accordance with the
law, unburied<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>.’ Now the law, we know, in ordaining the penalty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>
of death, ordained it as a satisfaction of the murdered man’s claims
to vengeance. The State, so to speak, sided with the dead man
and assisted him to exact blood for blood. Again the stoning of
the dead body by representatives of the city was intended, we are
expressly told, to free the whole city from guilt&mdash;from guilt, that
is, in the eyes of the murdered man, who might otherwise visit his
wrath upon the city as though it had consented to the crime or
had too lightly punished it. Can it then be supposed that the
State was actuated by any other motive in carrying out the rest
of the penalty? It was surely still in deference to the murdered
man’s desires that the murderer’s corpse was left unburied. To
refuse burial was the surest means of condemning the man to
resuscitation and thereby of satisfying his former victim’s uttermost
demands.</p>

<p>Thus our detailed examination of the Aeschylean catalogue of
penalties establishes beyond doubt that of which we had already
had some evidence, namely, that all the punishments which were
inflicted on the murderer&mdash;and, in popular belief, inflicted by the
murdered man on his own behalf&mdash;were an exact reproduction of
the sufferings which the murdered man himself had undeservingly
endured, and culminated therefore, as they should, in the blood-guilty
man becoming, like his victim, a <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>The main problem then of this section is now fully solved;
but incidentally much light has been thrown upon the character
ascribed by the Greek people in antiquity to those <i>revenants</i> who
were not merely pitiable sufferers but were active in bringing a
like doom upon those who had wronged them. And the character
of these Avengers approximates very closely to that of the modern
<i>vrykolakes</i>. True, there is one fundamental difference; the ancient
Avenger directed his wrath solely against the author of his sufferings,
or at the most extended it only to those who, owing to him
the duty of furthering his vengeance, had proved lax and cowardly
therein; the modern <i>vrykolakas</i> is unreasoning in his wrath and
plagues indiscriminately all who fall in his way. But the actual
sufferings which the <i>vrykolakas</i> inflicts are identical with those
which furnished Aeschylus with his tale of threatened horrors.
Modern stories there are in plenty, which tell how the <i>vrykolakas</i>
springs upon his victim and rends him and drinks his blood; how
sheer terror of his aspect has driven men mad; how, in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>
escape him, whole families have been driven forth from their
native island to wander in exile<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>; how death has often been the
issue of his assaults; and how those whom a <i>vrykolakas</i> has slain
become themselves <i>vrykolakes</i>. Only his unreasoning and indiscriminate
fury is necessarily of Slavonic origin; his acts are the
acts of those ancient <i>revenants</i> whose own wrongs rightfully made
them the Avengers of blood. Apart from the one Slavonic trait,
the characters of the <i>vrykolakas</i> and the ancient Avenger are
identical.</p>

<p>And perhaps this identity is most clearly seen in the one case
in which the old Avenger punished not only the immediate author
of his own wrongs, but a whole community which had subsequently
given the guilty man an asylum. We have noticed how Antiphon
ventured to threaten an Athenian jury with such punishment at
the hands of the dead man if they wrongfully acquitted his
murderer. In the same spirit Aeschylus makes the Furies, as the
agents of the dead Clytemnestra, menace the whole land of Attica
with a venomous curse that shall blast man and beast and herb in
revenge for the wresting of Orestes from their grasp<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>. And such
too is the dread which in the <i>Phoenissae</i> of Euripides stirs Creon
to make to the blood-guilty Oedipus this appeal: ‘Nay, remove
thee hence: verily ’tis not in scorn that I say this, nor in enmity
to thee, but because of thine Avengers, in fear lest the land suffer
some hurt<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>.’ In such cases the punishments with which a whole
community is threatened, although still a reasonable measure,
approach most nearly to the indiscriminate violence of the modern
<i>vrykolakas</i>.</p>

<p>For the fulfilment of such threats as these we must turn to
the <i>Supplices</i> of Aeschylus, and there we shall find a description
of just such a devastation as is said to have been suffered by the
inhabitants of Santorini and many other places in the seventeenth
century. The story of Aeschylus tells how ‘there came unto the
Argive land, from the shore of Naupactus, Apis, son of Apollo,
both healer and seer, and cleansed the land of monsters that
destroyed mankind, even of those that Earth, tainted with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>
pollutions of blood shed of old, sent up in wrath to work havoc,
fearsome as a dragon-brood to dwell among<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>.’ What then were
these monsters? I will venture to say that any Greek peasant of
to-day, could he but read and understand the Aeschylean description,
would furnish a better commentary upon those lines
than the most learned discourse thereon that any scholar has
written; and his commentary would be summed up in the one
word <i>vrykolakes</i>. For, vigorous as the description is, its vigour
comes less of dramatic word-building than of fidelity to the
horrors of popular superstition, and no other single passage could
so fully establish the unity of ancient and modern belief. For
while the actual language contains all the words<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> which in
antiquity were bound up with the superstition&mdash;the ‘pollution’
which comes of bloodshed, the ‘wrath’ which follows thereon and
in which Earth herself is here made to share, and the ‘sending
up’ by Earth of the Avengers&mdash;the thought of the passage is a
faithful reflection of what the Greek peasants still believe, that
a violent death is among the chief causes of resuscitation, that the
earth sends up the dead man raging to deal destruction, and that
with others of his kind he consorts and conspires in veritable
dragon-bands; and men still tell of gifted seers and healers,
such as Apis, summoned in hot haste to panic-stricken hamlets to
allay the pest. The <span class="greek">κνώδαλα βροτοφθόρα</span> of Aeschylus, ‘the
monsters that destroy mankind,’ are indeed but little removed
from the modern <i>vrykolakes</i>.</p>

<p>Is it not then clear also on what sources Aeschylus drew for
his picture of the Furies themselves? We have seen how, for
dramatic purposes, they were substituted for a <i>revenant</i> wreaking
his own vengeance. Clytemnestra herself in bodily form should
have been the Avenger, if popular superstition had not been in
this respect too gross; but the Erinyes take her place in the actual
execution of vengeance, and she herself appears only as a ghost
to instigate them to their work. But, when that substitution was
effected, did not Aeschylus clearly transfer to the Erinyes the
whole character and even the appearance popularly attributed to
the human Avenger? They are black and loathly to look upon<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
their breath is deadly to approach<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>; the smell of blood is a joy to
them<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>; they follow like hounds upon their victim’s trail<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>; they
torment him both body and soul<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>; they fasten upon his living
limbs and gorge themselves with his blood<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>; and if any would
harbour him from their pursuit, the venom of their wrath falls
like a plague upon the land, and devastates it<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>; they are monsters,
<span class="greek">κνώδαλα</span><a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>&mdash;and the recurrence of this word is significant&mdash;abhorrent
alike to gods and to men<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>. The description is surely
not that which Aeschylus would himself have invented for beings
who should come afterwards to be worshipped as ‘revered goddesses,’
<span class="greek">σεμναὶ θεαί</span>. The difficulty of that transition in the play
itself cannot but arrest the attention of every reader; it is a
difficulty which even the genius of Aeschylus could not remove.
Why then did he draw so loathsome a portrait of the Erinyes
in the earlier part of the play? Why did he create that difficulty?
The reason, I suggest, was that he followed once more, and this
time almost too faithfully, the popular traditions, and, while he
would not represent a real <i>revenant</i> on the stage, transferred to
those demonic agents, by whom the work of vengeance was
vicariously performed, all the attributes popularly associated with
the prototypes of the modern <i>vrykolakas</i>.</p>

<p>Thus then the history of the modern belief in <i>vrykolakes</i> has
been fully traced. The ancients also believed that for certain
causes&mdash;the same causes in the main as are still assigned&mdash;men
were doomed to remain incorruptible after death and to rise again
in bodily form from their graves, and that one class of these
<i>revenants</i>, those namely who had wrongs of their own to avenge,
inflicted upon their enemies (and upon any who shielded or
harboured them) the same sufferings as are now generally believed
to be inflicted in an unreasoning manner by all classes of <i>vrykolakes</i>
alike upon mankind at large, with no justification, such as a
natural desire for vengeance might afford, in the case of those
whose resuscitation is not the outcome of any injury or neglect
at the hands of other men, and with no discrimination between
friend and foe on the part of those who have real wrongs to
avenge. Remove the unreasoning element in the character of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span>
<i>vrykolakas</i>, and the <i>revenant</i> in which the folk of ancient Greece
believed remains.</p>

<p>But, if they believed in him, they must have called him by
some name. Aeschylus’ phrase <span class="greek">κνώδαλα βροτοφθόρα</span>, ‘monsters
that destroy mankind,’ is a description rather than a name.
What were the reasonable <i>vrykolakes</i> of ancient Greece called?
That is now the one question which must be answered in order
to make our enquiry complete.</p>

<p>Briefly my answer is this, that the particular class of <i>revenants</i>
with which the present section has mainly dealt, the Avengers
of blood, were known by three several names, <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span>, <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>,
and <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>, but that literature contains no word which
could serve as a collective designation for all classes alike. I hope
however to show that the Greek language was not originally
defective in this respect, but that the term <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>, although
regularly used from the fifth century onwards in the narrow
sense of an Avenger, had originally a wider application and denoted
simply a <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>Now the interpretation which I give to these three words
is not that which is commonly accepted. Anyone who will turn
to a lexicon will find that to each of the three is assigned
a double signification in connexion with blood-guilt. All three
are said to denote either a god who punishes the blood-guilty or
the blood-guilty man who is punished. Thus a god, it is alleged,
may be called <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span> (literally a ‘polluter’) because he punishes
the polluted&mdash;a somewhat obvious misnomer; or again <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>,
because he ‘does not forget’ but punishes the sinner&mdash;a derivation
which, as I shall show later, cannot be accepted; or thirdly <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>,
as the being who was ‘turned to’ by the murdered man
and was besought to avenge his cause&mdash;a somewhat circuitous
way for the word to arrive at its active sense of ‘Avenger.’ And,
secondly, a man, it is said, was called <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span> when, being himself
polluted, he was liable to be ‘a polluter’ of other men with whom
he came in contact&mdash;a view which is certainly defensible; <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>
as one whose sin ‘could not be forgotten’&mdash;an interpretation almost
beyond the pale of serious discussion; and <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> because,
being blood-guilty, he ‘turned towards’ some god for purification&mdash;an
explanation which may be right&mdash;whence the word came to
denote in general a polluted person who still needed purification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span></p>

<p>Thus in my view, as I have indicated, the greater part of the
information in the lexicons with regard to these three words is
inaccurate; and my reasons for disputing the received interpretations
will be set forth point by point as I offer my own
interpretations in their stead.</p>

<p>In dealing with the first group of meanings assigned to the
three words, by which they came, somehow or other, to be used
with the common active signification of ‘Avenger,’ my main
contention will be that, as regards their primary and strictest
usage, all three words were applied not to gods but to men&mdash;men
who, having been murdered, sought to requite their murderers&mdash;and
were only secondarily extended to the agents, whether divine
or human, to whom those dead men committed the task of
vengeance; but I shall also endeavour to show, as regards the
literal meaning of the three words severally, that the interpretation
by means of which their final sense of ‘Avenger’ has
generally been elicited from them is in each case wrong, and
that, in the case of the word <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> in particular, a right
understanding of its original meaning gives very important
results.</p>

<p>And in dealing with the second group of meanings, by which
the three words are said to denote three only slightly different
aspects of one and the same person&mdash;a murderer who is <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span>
as polluted and spreading pollution, <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> as pursued by
vengeance, and <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> as still needing purification&mdash;I
shall maintain that these alleged uses of the first two words
do not exist, and, as regards the third, I will offer a suggestion,
but a suggestion only, as to the means by which it acquired this
signification which it unquestionably bore.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to deal first with <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span> and <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>
as being parallel in usage throughout, and to reserve <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>
for later consideration.</p>

<p>The clearest example of that which I take to be the original
usage of <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span> is furnished by Euripides. In that scene of
mutual recrimination between Medea and Jason, after that in
revenge for her husband’s faithlessness she has slain their children,
there comes at last from her lips the brutal taunt, as she points to
the dead, ‘They live no more: that truth at least will sting thee’;
and Jason answers, ‘Nay, but they live, to wreak vengeance on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span>
thy head (<span class="greek">σῷ κάρᾳ μιάστορες</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>.’ No language could be more
simple, more explicit. The very children who lay there murdered
at Medea’s feet, they and none other should be the <i>Miastores</i>, the
Avengers of their own foul deaths.</p>

<p>But of course the word has other applications also. When
Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> made the Erinyes threaten that even when Orestes
should have fled beneath the earth, he should find another Avenger
(<span class="greek">μιάστορα</span>) to plague him in their stead, the whole tenor of the
passage compels us to understand that that other Avenger is some
deity or demon of the nether world&mdash;a divine, not a human,
<i>Miastor</i>, though at the same time one who will act, like the
Erinyes themselves, on behalf of the murdered Clytemnestra.</p>

<p>And, yet again, the same term is applied to a living man,
when, as next of kin to him who has been murdered, he is in
duty bound to exact vengeance. This time Sophocles is our
authority, and the person of whom the word is used is Orestes.
‘Oft,’ says Electra to Clytemnestra, ‘oft hast thou reproached me
with saving him to take vengeance upon thee (<span class="greek">σοὶ τρέφειν μιάστορα</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>.’</p>

<p>These three passages then illustrate the threefold application
of the name <i>Miastor</i>, and the question to be answered is which
represents the primary usage of the word. To multiply instances
of each or any would be of no avail; the question is not of the
frequency of each usage; the commonest is not necessarily the
earliest. How then is the question to be answered? It is,
I think, already answered. We have seen that in popular belief
the murdered man was the prime avenger of his own wrongs, and
that even in literature, when the execution of vengeance is wholly
transferred either to the nearest kinsman or to some demonic
power, the murdered man is still recognised as the principal and
the others are only his agents. It is this relation between them
which settles the question. A principal does not act in the name
of his agents, but the agents in the name of their principal. The
name <i>Miastor</i> therefore belonged first to the dead man himself,
and was only extended afterwards to those who wrought vengeance
on his behalf.</p>

<p>So much for the usage of the word. Next, how did it acquire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span>
the meaning of ‘Avenger,’ which it undoubtedly possessed? This
can be only a matter of opinion. But since it appears to me
unscholarly and illogical to suppose that a word, which on the
grounds of formation must have first meant ‘one who causes
pollution,’ could have come to mean ‘one who punishes pollution,’
I may at least offer an alternative suggestion. The murdered
man, I admit, can hardly be said to have ‘caused’ the pollution
of his murderer, or at any rate he could only have caused
it involuntarily. But he might well be regarded as active in
debarring the murderer from the means of purification and in
keeping the pollution, as it were, fresh and virulent, with intent
to isolate his enemy and to ban him from the abodes of his
fellow-men. And some indication of such an activity is afforded
by the Erinyes&mdash;acting, as always, on Clytemnestra’s behalf;
they refuse to acknowledge the purification granted by Apollo to
Orestes, and they say moreover that their task is to ‘keep dark
and fresh the stain of blood<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>.’ The murdered man may therefore
have been believed, if not actually to cause and to create,
yet at least to promote and to re-create, the pollution of his
foe, and, by keeping the stains of blood as it were from fading
or being cleansed away, to wreak some part of his vengeance.
In this way the transition from the sense of ‘polluter’ to that of
‘avenger’ is at least, I submit, intelligible. This however is only
a side-issue. The important point is that the word <i>Miastor</i>, however
it may have come to mean ‘Avenger,’ was primarily applied
to the <i>revenant</i> himself, and only secondarily to any god.</p>

<p>The next name to be considered, <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>, is commonly
accounted a synonym of <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span>, denoting in actual usage a ‘god
of vengeance,’ and meaning literally ‘one who does not forget’
blood-guiltiness. I too hold it to be a synonym of <i>Miastor</i>, but to
denote therefore primarily not a god but a human <i>revenant</i>
seeking vengeance, and only afterwards, by a transference of
usage, a god or living man acting in the name of the dead;
while, as for the supposed derivation, I count it absolutely
untenable.</p>

<p>And first as regards the application of the word; after what
has been, I hope, a fairly exhaustive study of the passages of
classical literature in which it occurs, I am bound to confess that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>
though the instances of its use are far more numerous than those
of <i>Miastor</i>, I am still unable to select three passages and to say
‘Here are my proofs of the triple application of the word.’ Indeed
all that I can prove by the evidence of any single passage taken
alone is curiously enough the existence of what I take to have
been the rarest of the three usages&mdash;the application of the name
<i>Alastor</i> to the kinsman of the dead man, as being the agent
of his vengeance. Just as Sophocles speaks of Orestes being
preserved as a <i>Miastor</i> to take vengeance on Clytemnestra for
his father’s death, so does Aeschylus make the same Orestes name
himself an <i>Alastor</i> on the score of the vengeance which he has
taken. ‘Queen Athene,’ he prays, ‘at Loxias’ bidding am I come;
receive thou me graciously, avenger as I am, no murderer, nor
of defiled hand ... <span class="greek">ἀλάστορα, οὐ προστρόπαιον, οὐδ’ ἀφοίβαντον
χέρα</span><a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>.’ Such, I am convinced, is the right rendering of the
passage. The lexicons indeed cite the line as an example of
the alleged passive meaning of <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>&mdash;one who suffers from
divine vengeance, an accursed wretch<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>; and I acknowledge that
such a meaning would make passable sense of the passage; for
Orestes was indeed suffering from the vengeance of the Erinyes.
But I hold, and I shall endeavour to prove later, that <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>
never possessed a passive meaning, and I claim moreover that
the active meaning of ‘Avenger,’ which I attribute to the word
here as elsewhere, is immensely preferable in itself. For Orestes
throughout pleads justification<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>; he has avenged murder, not
committed it; he has discharged a duty to his dead sire, not
perpetrated a wanton crime against his mother; he slew her
indeed, but his motive was pious, and the ordaining of his act
divine. On the grounds therefore, first, of the word’s own active
meaning, secondly, of the whole trend of Orestes’ defence of his
conduct, and last, but by no means least, of the exact parallel
furnished by Sophocles’ use of the word <i>Miastor</i>, I am confident
that <i>Alastor</i> as applied by Orestes to himself means an ‘Avenger.’</p>

<p>That the word however was not primarily applied to the kinsman
acting on behalf of the murdered man will be universally
conceded; in the vast majority of passages some supernatural being
is clearly intended. But it has been too hastily assumed that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>
supernatural avengers were always gods or demons; that they
were often so conceived I do not doubt; but, as a matter of fact,
I have discovered no single passage of classical literature which can
be said finally and absolutely in itself to demand that interpretation.
In many instances the probabilities are in favour of the <i>Alastores</i>
being regarded as a class of avenging demons; in many others it
is equally good or even better to suppose that they are the dead
men themselves in person.</p>

<p>What then are the foundations upon which the received
notion, that the <i>Alastores</i> were always gods, is based? It might
perhaps be urged that the word <i>Alastor</i> found a place among the
many epithets and titles conferred by worshippers upon Zeus<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>
in order to indicate the particular exercise of his all-reaching
power which their hearts desired. It might also be urged that
Clement of Alexandria names the <i>Alastores</i> among those classes
of gods whom the pagan Greeks had evolved from the naughtiness
of their own imagination as types and personifications of the
baser human passions<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>. But neither of these facts can serve to
substantiate the contention that the <i>Alastores</i> were primarily and
necessarily gods. The occasional use of a word as an epithet of
Zeus cannot be held to prove the general appropriation of that word
to a class of lesser gods; while the statement of Clement is the
statement of a man designedly vilifying the whole Greek religion,
neither appreciating nor desirous to appreciate its refinements, but
willing rather to overwhelm it utterly, its better and its worse
elements alike, with the torrent of his invective and reprobation.
To him the <i>Alastores</i> appeared as supernatural beings instinct
with the pagan passion of revenge, false gods therefore or devils,
fit objects whereon to pour out the vials of righteous wrath and
Christian scorn. He was not concerned to be wholly just or
wholly accurate. Indeed the very sources from which he drew
the idea that the <i>Alastores</i> were gods are still open to us; it is
the Greek Tragedians whom he holds guilty of this naughty
invention; it is the Greek Tragedians who remain for us the
fountain-head of information concerning these Avengers, and who
will on examination make it clear that they were not primarily
or necessarily gods.</p>

<p>The single passage in Greek Tragedy which has been often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
regarded as evidence in favour of Clement’s classification of
<i>Alastores</i> among gods is on fuller enquiry rather a refutation of
that view. In the <i>Persae</i> of Aeschylus the messenger, who
reports to the queen the disaster which has befallen the Persian
fleet, sets it down to supernatural agency:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἦρξεν μὲν ὦ δέσποινα, τοῦ παντὸς κακοῦ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">φανεὶς ἀλάστωρ ἢ κακὸς δαίμων ποθέν<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This has generally been taken to mean that the beginning of
the disaster was due to the sudden appearance of ‘some vengeful
or malicious deity.’ But elsewhere in Tragedy <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> is treated
not as adjective but as substantive; and, since there is no compulsion
to suppose other than the ordinary use of the word here,
it appears better to translate the phrase ‘some Avenger or some
malicious god.’ In other words the real, if unemphatic, contrast
implied in the phrase is not between <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> and <span class="greek">κακός</span>&mdash;no contrast
is possible there<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>&mdash;but between <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> and <span class="greek">δαίμων</span>. The
inference therefore is rather that the <i>Alastor</i> in this passage was
not conceived as a deity.</p>

<p>There are other passages of Greek Tragedy also in which
the balance of probability seems to me to incline towards interpreting
the name <i>Alastor</i> in the sense of a <i>revenant</i> and not of a
god. Two such occur in the <i>Medea</i> of Euripides&mdash;the same play,
be it noted, which contains that perfectly plain statement that
the dead children of Medea are themselves the <i>Miastores</i> who will
punish her. The first is in the scene in which Medea works
herself up to the perpetration of her crime. Passionate love of
her children, passionate jealousy and fury against their father,
alternate in tragic turmoil, until the tense agony of spirit is let
loose in that fierce oath,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘No, by the Avengers that lurk deep in hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er shall it come to pass that I should leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My children to mine enemies’ despite.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most surely they must die; and since they must,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas my womb bare them, ’tis my hand shall slay<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span></p>

<p>Strong and terrible would be the oath even if the <i>Alastores</i>, whose
wrath Medea thus defies, were gods or spirits; but the force and
the horror are doubled, if the <i>Alastores</i> here are of the same order
as those whom Jason names <i>Miastores</i> but a little later in the same
drama, and if therefore among those Avengers, in whose name the
murderous oath was sworn, were soon to be numbered those very
children whom Medea loved best and yet bound herself to slay
most foully.</p>

<p>The second passage occurs in Jason’s outburst of fury against
Medea when he first learns her crime. ‘’Tis thine Avenger whom
the gods have let light on me; for truly thou didst slay thine
own brother at his own hearth, or ever thou didst set foot in Argo’s
shapely hull<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>.’ Surely we are meant to understand that the dead
Absyrtus is himself the <i>Alastor</i>&mdash;for one <i>Alastor</i> only is named
this time, and that too as distinct from the gods (<span class="greek">θεοί</span>)&mdash;and that
Jason diverted to himself a portion of the dead man’s wrath by
wedding the blood-guilty woman. Again then the interpretation
of <i>Alastor</i> in the same sense in which, only a little later in the
same scene, <i>Miastor</i> is undoubtedly employed is, if not necessary,
yet vastly preferable.</p>

<p>To review here all the passages of Greek Tragedy in which
the word may advantageously be so understood, when at the same
time no single one of them constitutes a final proof of my view,
would be to encumber this enquiry to no purpose; but I may
perhaps be permitted to select one instance from a story of blood-guilt
other than that of which Medea is the centre.</p>

<p>This shall be from that scene in the <i>Hercules Furens</i> in
which the hero, sane now and overwhelmed with horror at the
ghastly slaughter of his own children which in a moment of
sudden madness he had wrought, receives from Theseus some
measure of consolation and advice. Early in that colloquy, ere
yet Theseus has had time to soothe the sufferings or to guide the
course of his stricken friend, Heracles cries to him in bitterness
of soul,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Theseus, hast view’d my triumph o’er my children?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and Theseus answers with gentle simplicity,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">I heard, and now I see the woes thou showst me.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Her.</i> Why then hast bared my head before the Sun?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Thes.</i> Where love joins, bloodshed to no vengeance moves.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is the connexion and significance of the last two lines which
I wish briefly to discuss. Theseus has used the word ‘taint’
(<span class="greek">μιαίνεις</span>), and Heracles at once seizes on it, emphasizes it, and
warns his friend to begone lest he be contaminated; and then
Theseus answers (to give a literal rendering) ‘No Avenger of
blood proceeds from them that love against them that love.’
What does this mean? The line is often translated as if Theseus
meant, ‘No, I will stay, for though an Avenger of blood may
probably pursue you, Heracles, I have no fear that he will touch
me who love you as a friend<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a>.’ A generous and sympathetic
utterance indeed! And how consistent with that fine burst of
feeling with which he had but a moment before refused to be
warned away:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Why warn’st thou me of blood with hand uplift?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In fear lest I be tainted by thy speech?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nought reck I of ill fortune at thy side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where once ’twas good; that hour must draw my heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou didst bring me safe from death to light;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, I hate friends whose gratitude grows old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hate the man that will enjoy good hap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But will not face foul weather with his friend<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Is this the man whose words, spoken but a moment later, shall
be interpreted to mean, ‘I will not run away, because the danger
that threatens my friend cannot hurt me’? The thought is
deeper, more generous, than that. Theseus is thinking not of
himself, but of his friend. It is the word ‘pollution,’ used first by
himself and caught up by Heracles, which arrests his attention.
Was his friend ‘polluted’ by a deed of blood, wrought in madness,
expiated in tears? Polluted? Yes, in the sense that religious
purification was required<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>. He cannot deny the pollution. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span>
could the deed also be punished as the murder of close kinsfolk
was wont to be punished? Could the children, albeit slain by
their own father’s hand, desire revenge upon him who loved them
and was loved of them? ‘No,’ he answers boldly, ‘pollution
(<span class="greek">μίασμα</span>) there is, but no <i>Alastor</i>, no Avenger of blood, can come
from them that love against them that love.’ How then does
Theseus picture the <i>Alastor</i> who, but for the bond of love between
the father and his dead children, would seek vengeance for their
death? The phrase which he uses is ambiguous&mdash;perhaps deliberately
ambiguous&mdash;<span class="greek">οὐδεὶς ... ἐκ τῶν φίλων</span>. It may mean
equally well ‘no one of those who love’ or ‘no one coming from
those who love.’ But when the close correspondence of <span class="greek">μίασμα</span>,
‘pollution,’ and <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> ‘avenger,’ is noted in this passage, and
when it is also remembered that the dead children of Medea are
elsewhere plainly named <i>Miastores</i>, it is hard to suppose that an
audience familiar with the belief that the dead themselves avenged
their own wrongs would not have interpreted the ambiguous phrase
to mean ‘none of these children shall rise up from the grave as an
<i>Alastor</i>, for love is stronger than vengeance.’</p>

<p>But such doubt as still remains is set at rest when we turn
from the usage of the word <i>Alastor</i> to its origin and enquire
how it obtained the sense of ‘Avenger.’ What is its derivation?</p>

<p>Two conjectures seem to have been made by the ancients and
are recorded by early commentators and lexicographers<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>. The
one connects the word with the root of <span class="greek">λανθάνω</span>, ‘I escape notice,’
and extracts a meaning in a variety of ways, leaving it open to
choice, for example, whether it shall mean a god whose notice
nothing escapes or a man who commits acts which cannot escape
some god’s notice. The other conjecture refers the word to the
root of <span class="greek">ἀλάομαι</span>, ‘I wander.’ It is between these two proposed
derivations that our choice lies; nor can we obtain much help
from the greatest modern authorities. Curtius<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> unhesitatingly
adopts the latter, Brugmann<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> the former, nor does either of them
so much as mention the possibility of the alternative. I must
therefore discuss the question without reference to these authorities,
knowing that, if I run counter to the one, I have the countenance
of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[472]</span></p>

<p>Is then <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>, in the sense of a ‘non-forgetter,’ a possible
formation from the root of <span class="greek">λανθάνω</span>? My own answer to that
question is a decided negative, and my reasons are as follows.
Substantives denoting the agent and formed with the suffix <span class="greek">-τωρ</span>
(<span class="greek">-τορ-</span>) can only be so formed direct from a verb-stem, as <span class="greek">ῥήτωρ</span>
from <span class="greek">ϝρε</span> or <span class="greek">ϝερ</span> appearing in <span class="greek">ἐρῶ</span> etc., <span class="greek">μήστωρ</span> from the stem of
<span class="greek">μήδομαι</span>, <span class="greek">ἀφήτωρ</span> answering to the verb <span class="greek">ἀφίημι</span>, <span class="greek">ἐπιβήτωρ</span> to
<span class="greek">ἐπιβαίνω</span>. It is among these and other such examples that
Brugmann places the anomalous <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>, to be connected with
<span class="greek">ἄλαστος, λήθω</span>. But evidently, in order that <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> may be
parallel, let us say, to <span class="greek">ἀφήτωρ</span>, we must postulate the existence of
an impossible verb <span class="greek">ἀ-λήθω</span> or <span class="greek">ἀ-λανθάνομαι</span>, ‘I non-forget.’ Nor
would it mend matters to suppose, first, the formation, direct
from <span class="greek">λήθω</span>, of a <i>nomen agentis</i> of the form <span class="greek">λάστωρ</span>, a ‘forgetter’;
for the privative <span class="greek">ἀ-</span> appears only in adjectives and adverbs and in
such verbs and substantives as are formed directly from them, as
<span class="greek">ἀμνημονεῖν</span> from <span class="greek">ἀμνήμων</span> etc., and cannot be prefixed at pleasure
to a substantive or verb not so formed; <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> could no more
be formed from an hypothetical substantive <span class="greek">λάστωρ</span><a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>, than could
an hypothetical verb <span class="greek">ἀ-λανθάνεσθαι</span> be formed from <span class="greek">λανθάνεσθαι</span>.
Etymologically then the derivation of <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> from <span class="greek">ἀ-</span> privative
and the root of <span class="greek">λήθω</span> is impossible, and its sense of ‘Avenger’
was not developed from the meaning ‘one who does not forget.’</p>

<p>On the other hand, to the connexion of <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> with the
verb <span class="greek">ἀλᾶσθαι</span>, ‘to wander,’ no exception can be taken. Not only
is the formation simple, but an exact parallel is forthcoming. As
the substantive <span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span> stands to the verb <span class="greek">μιαίνω</span>, so does the
substantive <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> stand to a by-form of <span class="greek">ἀλάομαι</span>, which is fairly
frequent in Tragedy, <span class="greek">ἀλαίνω</span><a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a>. It follows then that <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>
meant originally a ‘wanderer.’</p>

<p>But, when once that primary meaning is discovered, there can
be no further doubt as to the primary application of the term.
Of the three possible exactors of vengeance&mdash;the <i>revenant</i> himself,
some demonic agent, and the nearest kinsman&mdash;the first alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span>
could be aptly described as a ‘wanderer’; moreover we know that
the murdered man was actually so conceived, and that, among the
punishments by which he sought to make his murderer suffer the
same lot as he himself endured, one of the most conspicuous was
the punishment of wandering and exile. The name <i>Alastor</i> therefore,
like <i>Miastor</i>, denoted first of all the dead man himself, and
was only secondarily extended to human or divine agents seeking
vengeance on his behalf.</p>

<p>It remains only to enquire how the meaning ‘Avenger’ was
evolved from the meaning ‘Wanderer,’ and so completely superseded
it that the name <i>Alastores</i> was extended to those agents
who were in no obvious sense ‘Wanderers’ but simply ‘Avengers.’</p>

<p>The first occurrence of the word is in the <i>Iliad</i>, as the proper
name of a Greek warrior<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>. This fact tends to show that the word
had as yet acquired none of that ill-omened sense which it undoubtedly
bears in Greek Tragedy. It was used rather, we may
believe, in its original and literal sense of ‘wanderer,’ and the
adoption of such a word as a proper name is entirely consistent
with the principles of Homeric nomenclature. Hector, Nestor,
Mēstor, are famous names of the same class.</p>

<p>Otherwise than as a proper name the word is not used in
Homer, nor does it occur at all again, so far as I am aware, before
the time of Aeschylus. It is during this interval then that the
evolution of meaning must have taken place; for by the age of
Aeschylus the idea of vengeance&mdash;and vengeance of a horrible
kind&mdash;had become the ordinary signification of the word. My view
then is that the intervening centuries had witnessed a gradual
differentiation of the several words which alike originally meant
a ‘wanderer,’ a differentiation such that <span class="greek">ἀλήτης</span> remained the
ordinary and general term, while <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> was little by little
restricted to the wanderer from the dead, the <i>revenant</i>; and that
subsequently from meaning a <i>revenant</i> of any and every kind it
became limited to that single class of <i>revenants</i> whose wanderings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span>
were guided by the desire for revenge&mdash;the class to whom the
name <i>Miastores</i> had always belonged.</p>

<p>Some evidence for the first stage in this development of
meaning is furnished by the Tragic usage of the verb from which
the substantive is derived; for in both its forms, <span class="greek">ἀλᾶσθαι</span> and
<span class="greek">ἀλαίνειν</span>, it continued to be applied to any of the restless dead,
when the substantive <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>, as I conceive, had come to be
appropriated to the Avenger only. Indeed it might almost be
thought that both Aeschylus and Euripides had an inkling of the
derivation and earlier meaning of the substantive; for while
idiom debarred them from using <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> in the large sense of
any <i>revenant</i>, they certainly used the corresponding verb in
contexts which suggest that those who thus ‘wander’ were not
imagined by them as vague impalpable ghosts, but possessed for
them rather the real substance and physical traits of a <i>revenant</i>.
Thus in the <i>Eumenides</i>, though Clytemnestra could not be permitted
to play the part of a <i>revenant</i> and appears only as a ghost,
yet the more gross and popular conception of her is clearly
present to the poet’s mind. Though a ghost, she points to the
wounds which her son’s hands inflicted<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>; though a ghost, she is
made to exhort the Erinyes to vengeance ‘on behalf of her very
soul’ (<span class="greek">τῆς ἐμῆς πέρι ψυχῆς</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>. Strange gestures and strange
language indeed, if the so-called ghost had been conceived as a
mere disembodied soul! But the popular conception of the
<i>revenant</i> penetrated even here. And was it not the same conception
which suggested the phrase <span class="greek">αἰσχρῶς ἀλῶμαι</span>, ‘I wander
in dishonour<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a>’? In the popular belief, as we know, the murderer
was bound to wander after death, suffering as he had wrought;
and it is as a murderess<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> that Clytemnestra avows herself condemned
to shameful wanderings. ‘To wander,’ <span class="greek">ἀλᾶσθαι</span>, sums up
the suffering which the murderer, like his victim, must incur
after death. It is likely then that the name <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> too was
originally applied to any ‘wanderer’&mdash;whether murderer or
murdered&mdash;before it acquired the connotation of vindictiveness
and so became appropriated to the latter only.</p>

<p>Again Euripides uses the same verb of one whose body has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span>
not received burial. This time there is no connexion with blood-guilt
at all, but the lines are simply the plaint of captive wife for
husband slain in battle: ‘oh beloved, oh husband mine, dead art
thou and wanderest unburied, unwatered with tears’&mdash;<span class="greek">σὺ μὲν
φθίμενος ἀλαίνεις, ἄθαπτος, ἄνυδρος</span><a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a>. ‘To wander unburied’&mdash;could
there be a simpler description of a <i>revenant</i>? Does not the
whole misery of the unburied dead consist in this&mdash;that they
must wander? It is almost inconceivable then that the name
<i>Alastor</i>, ‘wanderer,’ should have been originally applied only to a
single class of the wandering dead&mdash;to those whose wanderings
were directed towards vengeance, and not also to those whose
wanderings were more aimless, more pitiable, whose whole existence
might have been summed up in that one word ‘wandering.’
At some time then between the age of Homer and that of
Aeschylus <i>Alastor</i>, I hold, meant simply <i>revenant</i>.</p>

<p>How then shall we explain that caprice of language which,
according to this Tragic usage, permitted all the unhappy dead
to be said ‘to wander’ (<span class="greek">ἀλᾶσθαι, ἀλαίνειν</span>), but apparently forbade
them to be collectively named ‘wanderers’ (<span class="greek">ἀλάστορες</span>)?
How did <i>Alastor</i> acquire its sense of ‘Avenger’ and become
restricted to one class of <i>revenant</i> only?</p>

<p>It might be sufficient answer to point out that those <i>revenants</i>
who were bent on avenging their own wrongs are likely always to
have occupied a prominent place in popular superstition simply
because they inspired most terror in the popular mind; other
<i>revenants</i> were harmless, and, as harmless, liable to be little regarded
and seldom named; and the most conspicuous class might
thus have appropriated to itself the name which properly belonged
to all. But there is another influence which, if it did not cause,
may at least have facilitated and quickened the change&mdash;the
influence of the word <span class="greek">ἄλαστος</span>, ‘unforgotten,’ which, as I have
noted above, was commonly and naturally, in an age when etymology
was not science but guess-work, connected with <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>.
Etymologically the two words have nothing in common; but that
is no obstacle to the supposition that, in their usage, their casual
but close similarity of form rendered the meaning of the one
susceptible to the influence of the other. Nay more, the fact
that the two words, it matters not how erroneously, were actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span>
in early times referred to a common origin<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> warrants the suggestion
that such influence had been exercised. Now <span class="greek">ἄλαστος</span>
always remained in meaning true to its derivation. Itself employed
in the passive sense, ‘unforgotten,’ it seems to have made
over the active meaning, ‘unforgetting,’ ‘vindictive’ (which, on
the analogy of <span class="greek">ἄπρακτος</span> and a score of similar forms, it should
naturally have possessed), to the apparently kindred word <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>.
This adventitious meaning accorded well with the popular conception
of the most conspicuous class of ‘wanderers’ from the
grave&mdash;those whose wanderings had a vindictive aim; and thus,
by the help of the accidental resemblance of two words, it seems to
have come to pass that the term <i>Alastores</i> ceased to be applicable
to all kinds of <i>revenants</i> and denoted only the ‘Avengers.’ At this
point it became in fact synonymous with <i>Miastores</i>, and, like that
word, enlarged its scope so as to denote not only the prime
Avenger, the <i>revenant</i> himself, but also any divine or human
agents employed by him as subsidiary Avengers.</p>

<p>So much then for the first meaning which the lexicons
attach to the words <i>Alastor</i> and <i>Miastor</i>; the second interpretation
of them, in relation to a blood-guilty man, may be more
briefly treated. <i>Alastor</i> in this passive sense is alleged to mean
a man who suffers from the vengeance of one who is an <i>Alastor</i>
in the active sense; and <i>Miastor</i> to mean a man who is himself
polluted and therefore pollutes those with whom he associates.</p>

<p>As regards <i>Alastor</i>, this explanation stands already condemned
by the fact that it pre-supposes the derivation from <span class="greek">λανθάνομαι</span>,
and even then it does fresh and incredible violence to language;
a sane philologist may commit the error of deriving <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span>
from <span class="greek">λανθάνομαι</span> and making it mean ‘one who does not forget’;
but only the maddest could dream of interpreting it as ‘one who
does deeds which others do not forget.’ But, if in spite of this
we trouble to turn up the references which the lexicons give under
this heading, it is obvious at once that there is no more support
for such a meaning in idiomatic usage than in etymological origin.
Three references are cited. The first is to that passage of the
<i>Eumenides</i> in which Orestes declares himself <span class="greek">ἀλάστορα, οὐ προστρόπαιον</span><a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>,
a phrase which means, as I have already shown, ‘an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span>
avenger, not a murderer.’ This then should be classified as an
example of the active, not of the hypothetical passive, meaning of
<i>Alastor</i>. Of the other two passages, one is from the <i>Ajax</i> of
Sophocles, where the hero in his anger and despair speaks of the
guileful enemies who robbed him of his prize as <i>Alastores</i><a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>, and
the other a passage from Demosthenes in which he criticizes
Aeschines for applying the word as an opprobrious name to Philip
of Macedon<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>. But in what possible sense could either Ajax’
enemies or Philip of Macedon be described as ‘suffering from
Avengers’? On the contrary, at the times when the word <i>Alastor</i>
was applied to them, their success should surely have suggested
that they were favoured by heaven, and their opponents rather
were the sufferers. What then was the meaning of the word thus
opprobriously employed? A meaning, I answer, very little removed
from that of ‘Avenger’ and arising out of it. For how
was the Avenger&mdash;be he the <i>revenant</i> himself or a demon acting
on his behalf&mdash;constantly pictured? Was it not as a fiend tormenting
with every torment the object of his wrath, plaguing
him, maddening him, sucking his very blood? Little wonder then
if the justice of that vengeance was sometimes obscured in men’s
minds by their horror of it, and if the word <i>Alastor</i> suggested to
them a fiend, a merciless tormentor. In that sense Ajax might
well apply the name to his enemies, and Aeschines to Philip.
Nor are other instances of it lacking. Demosthenes himself, for
all his criticism of Aeschines’ vulgarity in calling Philip <span class="greek">βάρβαρόν
τε καὶ ἀλάστορα</span>, ‘a foreign devil,’ used the same word of Aeschines
and his friends<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>; again, in Sophocles, the lion of Nemea for the
loss and havoc that he inflicted is unique among beasts that perish
in having merited the same sorry title&mdash;<span class="greek">βουκόλων ἀλάστωρ</span>, the
‘herdsmen’s Tormentor<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>’; and indeed, apart from living men and
animals, there are many instances in Tragedy<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> in which the word
<i>Alastor</i>, applied to some supernatural foe, <i>revenant</i> or demon, may
be more appropriately rendered by ‘fiend’ or ‘tormentor’ than by
‘avenger.’</p>

<p>And the same thing is true, I hold, of the word <i>Miastor</i>. The
theory of the lexicons, namely, that the word denotes a polluted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span>
and blood-guilty man because such an one is inevitably a ‘polluter’
of others, is certainly not intrinsically bad; for it recognises the
primary meaning of the word, ‘polluter,’ and bases the secondary
meaning ‘polluted’ upon a right understanding of the old belief
that pollution was contagious. But at the same time it gives
some occasion to wonder why the word should have been diverted
from its most natural meaning in order to denote that which the
cognate word <span class="greek">μιαρός</span> already expressed more simply. Moreover,
when examination is made of those passages which are claimed as
examples of such an usage, the theory becomes wholly unnecessary.
The two most specious examples are two passages from Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>
and Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>, in both of which the persons called <i>Miastores</i> are
Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. Now the authors of Agamemnon’s
death were certainly polluted, and might with justice have been
called <span class="greek">μιαροί</span>&mdash;that is admitted. But because they might have
been called <span class="greek">μιαροί</span> and actually are called <span class="greek">μιάστορες</span>, it does not
follow that, though the words have the same root, they also bear
the same meaning. Obviously the word ‘fiends,’ if <span class="greek">μιάστορες</span>
ever has that sense, would be an equally apt description of the
murderous pair. The choice therefore between these two renderings
here must be guided by more certain examples of usage
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Two may be selected as eminently clear. In one Orestes calls
Helen <span class="greek">τὴν Ἑλλάδος μιάστορα</span><a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>, where the word cannot mean a
‘polluted wretch,’ for the construction postulates an active meaning
in <i>Miastor</i>; nor yet can the phrase be intelligibly rendered ‘the
polluter of Greece,’ for there was no pollution involved in the
warfare which Helen had caused; clearly Orestes means ‘the
tormentor of Greece,’ the fiend who had proved the bane of
ships and men and cities. In the other passage Peleus applies
the word to Menelaus: ‘I look upon thee,’ he says, ‘as on
the murderer&mdash;the fiend-like destroyer (<span class="greek">μιάστορ’ ὥς τινα</span>)&mdash;of
Achilles<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>.’ Here again <i>Miastor</i> clearly bears an active sense, and
at the same time cannot be rendered ‘polluter.’ Menelaus had
brought upon Achilles not pollution but death, and the word
<i>Miastor</i> explains the word ‘murderer’ (<span class="greek">αὐθέντην</span>) which precedes
it&mdash;explains that the murder laid to Menelaus’ charge was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span>
the open violence of a stronger foe, but resembled the death-dealing
of some lurking fiend. In these two passages then the
interpretation of <i>Miastor</i> in the sense of ‘fiend,’ ‘tormentor,’
‘destroyer,’ is necessary and proven; and, this being known,
common reason bids us read more ambiguous scriptures in the
light thus obtained. There is therefore no call to suppose that
<span class="greek">μιάστωρ</span> ever meant ‘polluted’; from the active meaning ‘Avenger’
it developed, like <i>Alastor</i>, the broader sense of ‘Tormentor’ or
‘Fiendish Destroyer’; and these meanings completely satisfy the
conditions of Tragic and other usage of the words.</p>

<p>There remains the word <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>, to which the lexicons,
I admit, rightly ascribe a twofold meaning. It is clearly used
both of the Avenger of blood and also of the blood-guilty person
who is seeking purification. But as regards both the means by
which the first signification was obtained, and the primary application
of the word in that signification, I join issue. The second
meaning is more satisfactorily explained, and my criticism of it
will not go beyond an alternative suggestion.</p>

<p>The lexicons elucidate the first meaning as follows: <i>he to
whom one turns</i>, especially with supplications, <span class="greek">θεός</span> or <span class="greek">δαίμων
προστρόπαιος</span> the god <i>to whom the murdered person turns</i> for
vengeance, hence <i>an avenger</i>, like <span class="greek">ἀλάστωρ</span> ... hence also of the
<i>manes</i> of murdered persons, <i>visiting with vengeance, implacable</i>.</p>

<p>The objections to this explanation are obvious. It may well
be questioned whether <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> is at all likely to have had
any passive meaning&mdash;as it were a person who ‘is turned to’&mdash;when
the verb <span class="greek">προστρέπω</span> itself was, so far as I can ascertain,
never so used; and further, if a god had really been called <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>
because the murdered man turned for vengeance to him,
the extension of the term to the <i>manes</i> of murdered persons must
imply a conception of the murdered man turning for vengeance
towards&mdash;himself. This is not a little cumbrous; and for my part
I deny the existence of any passive sense of <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>.</p>

<p>I do however find two senses of the word, the one active,
corresponding to the transitive use of the verb <span class="greek">προστρέπειν</span> or
<span class="greek">προστρέπεσθαι</span> (for the middle as well as the active voice might
be used transitively, as will shortly appear), the other middle,
corresponding to the ordinary usage of the middle <span class="greek">προστρέπεσθαι</span>.
Thus the active meaning of <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> will be <i>turning</i> some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span>thing
<i>towards</i> or <i>against</i> someone; the middle meaning, <i>turning
oneself towards</i> someone.</p>

<p>The active usage is best illustrated by a passage of Aeschines,
in which he accuses Demosthenes of wilful perjury in calumniating
him, and then appeals to the jury in these words&mdash;<span class="greek">ἐάσετε οὖν τὸν
τοιοῦτον αὑτοῦ προστρόπαιον (μὴ γὰρ δὴ τῆς πόλεως) ἐν ὑμῖν
ἀναστρέφεσθαι</span><a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>; ‘Will you then allow this perjurer, who has
turned upon his own head (for I pray that it be not on the city)
the anger of the gods in whose name he swore, to continue in
your midst?’ Here the very brevity of the Greek, which I
am compelled to expand in translation, proves that Aeschines’
audience were perfectly familiar with an active meaning of <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>
with an evil connotation, ‘turning some misfortune or
punishment or vengeance upon someone.’</p>

<p>The middle sense of <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> is equally clearly exhibited
by Aeschylus, who in telling the story of Thyestes says that after
his banishment by his brother Atreus he came again <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος
ἑστίας</span><a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>, ‘turning himself (as a suppliant) towards the hearth’ of
his father’s home, so that his own life at least was spared out of
respect for the place.</p>

<p>Thus the two meanings of the word are established, and it
remains only to show how they were specially used in connexion
with blood-guilt.</p>

<p>In the active sense <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> was primarily applied, I
hold, like <i>Miastor</i> and <i>Alastor</i>, to the murdered man himself,
who ‘turned’ his wrath ‘against’ the murderer, or, if it so
happened, against the next of kin who had failed in his duty of
bringing the murderer to justice. It is precisely thus that Plato
uses the verb <span class="greek">προστρέπεσθαι</span> in recording the old tradition in
which he apparently reposed so much faith as to base his own
laws upon it. ‘If the nearest of kin,’ so runs the passage, ‘do
not seek vengeance for the deed, it is held that the pollution
devolves upon him, and that <i>the sufferer</i> (i.e. the dead man)
<i>turns upon him the suffering</i> (i.e. that which the homicide himself
should have incurred), and anyone who will may bring a suit
against him, etc.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>’ The words which I have italicised are in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span>
Greek <span class="greek">τοῦ παθόντος προστρεπομένου τὴν πάθην</span>, where the middle
presumably was preferred to the active because the sufferings
which the dead man inflicts are, as we already know and as the
language of the particular phrase itself suggests, exactly those
which he himself suffers. This usage of the verb, though it is
distinctly rare and probably a technicality of religion or law, is
so perfectly clear in this one example<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a>, that there should be no
hesitation about understanding the cognate word <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>
in the same sense. And indeed one lexicographer, Photius, shows
that he did so understand it; for he tells us that Zeus was sometimes
invoked under this title, as turning against murderers the
pollution (including perhaps the punishments) of their crime:
<span class="greek">Ζεὺς ... προστρόπαιος, ὁ προστρέπων τὸ ἄγος αὐτοῖς</span> (sc. <span class="greek">τοῖς
παλαμναίοις</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>&mdash;such are his actual words, and this time of course
the verb is rightly in the active, for Zeus is in no way personally
concerned but acts only in the interests of the dead man. Clearly
then it was in virtue of this active meaning that <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>
came to be practically a synonym of <i>Miastor</i> and <i>Alastor</i> in the
sense of an Avenger of blood.</p>

<p>Once more then we return to the same question which has
been propounded and answered with regard to those two other
names&mdash;to whom was the term <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span> primarily applied?</p>

<p>I find the application of it more restricted than that of the
other two words. It was used of the dead man himself, and it
was used of demons avenging his cause; but it was never used<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> of
the next of kin in the character of avenger&mdash;and that for the very
good reason that when the word was applied to a living man it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[482]</span>
bore an entirely different meaning, which has yet to be discussed,
the meaning of ‘blood-guilty.’</p>

<p>A few examples of each usage must be given. Both Antiphon
and Aeschylus apply the word to murdered men; Antiphon, in a
speech in which the kinsman, who has, as in duty bound, undertaken
the prosecution of the murderer, claims that, if the jury
wrongfully acquit, the dead man will not become <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>,
an Avenger, against his kinsmen who have done their best in his
service, but will visit his anger on the jury for condoning and
thereby sharing the blood-guilt<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a>; Aeschylus, in that list of penalties
which has been discussed, when he depicts the ‘madness and vain
terror,’ which will befall Orestes if he fail in his task, as an arrow
that flieth in darkness sped by powers of hell ‘at the behest of
fallen kindred that turn their vengeance upon him’ (<span class="greek">ἐκ προστροπαίων
ἐν γένει πεπτωκότων</span><a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a>). But equally clearly in other passages
the Avenger indicated is not the murdered man, but some divine
being. Antiphon again is an authority for this usage. Twice, in
a context similar to that which has just been noticed, he speaks
not of the murdered man himself becoming an Avenger, but of
certain divine powers&mdash;whom he also calls <span class="greek">ἀλιτήριοι</span>, the powers
that deal with sin&mdash;acting as Avengers (<span class="greek">προστρόπαιοι</span>) of the
dead<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a>. And similarly in later time Pausanias also speaks of ‘the
pollution (<span class="greek">μίασμα</span>) incurred by Pelops and of the Avenger (<span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>)
of Myrtilus<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>.’</p>

<p>Since then there is no question but that the word <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>
was actually applied both to dead men and to gods, to
which of the two did it refer primarily? We already know the
answer. The dead man himself, as a <i>revenant</i>, was the prime and
proper Avenger of his own wrongs; demons of vengeance acted only
in his name, as his subordinates and agents. To him therefore
the name primarily belonged. And even if we had not already
learnt this from other sources, the passage of Aeschylus, to which
I have just referred, might well guide us to the same conclusion.
The arrow that flieth in darkness is sped indeed, he says, ‘by
powers of hell’ (<span class="greek">τῶν ἐνερτέρων</span>)&mdash;the demonic agents of the
dead&mdash;but ‘at the behest of fallen kindred.’ The activity both
of the principal and of the agent is recognised in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span>
passage, and either might have been called <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>: but,
because the activity of both was plainly asserted, Aeschylus
reserved the name for the one to whom it primarily belonged,
the murdered man, who turns his wrath, who turns indeed
those powers of hell who execute his wrath, against his
enemies.</p>

<p>There now remains for consideration only the second meaning
of <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>; how could a word, which in reference to dead
men or to deities meant ‘an Avenger of blood,’ bear, in relation to
living men, the sense of ‘blood-guilty’? Very likely the dictionaries
are right in accepting the explanation of this use which Hesychius<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>
and others give. We have seen one case<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> in which the word clearly
has a middle sense ‘turning oneself towards’ a place or a person
in supplication; and there is no difficulty in supposing that the
word was used technically in the same sense of a blood-guilty man
who turned to some god or to some sanctuary in quest of purification.
This, I say, is very probably the right explanation. But
I may perhaps offer an alternative explanation which I do not
count preferable but merely possible. The active meaning of
<span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>, ‘turning something upon someone,’ might conceivably
have produced this sense of ‘blood-guilty’ as well as
the other sense ‘an Avenger of blood.’ As the dead man was
held to turn something, namely his wrath, against his enemy, so
might the murderer have been pictured as trying to turn something,
namely the pollution which he had incurred, upon some
object and so to cleanse himself therefrom. Now the chief feature
in the Delphic ceremony of purification was the slaying of a
sucking-pig<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>. This may of course have been merely a propitiatory
sacrifice; but it is possible also that the animal was really a
surrogate victim for the murderer himself, that by laying his
polluted hand on its head he transferred the religious uncleanness
from himself to it, and that, by the subsequent slaughter of the
now blood-guilty animal, he vicariously satisfied the old law that
blood could only be washed out by blood. This is only a conjecture,
and I leave others to judge of its probability; but, if the
ceremony had followed the lines which I have suggested, it is
easily intelligible that, in the technical language of religion, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span>
murderer who sought to turn his own pollution upon the victim
might have been called <span class="greek">προστρόπαιος</span>.</p>

<p>Thus then the problem of the ancient nomenclature of <i>revenants</i>
is solved, and the results are briefly these: all <i>revenants</i>
were originally called <span class="greek">ἀλάστορες</span>, ‘Wanderers’; but subsequently
that name was restricted only to the vengeful class of <i>revenants</i>,
to which the names <span class="greek">μιάστορες</span> and <span class="greek">προστρόπαιοι</span> had always
belonged; and for the more harmless and purely pitiable <i>revenants</i>
no name remained, but men said of such an one simply, ‘He
wanders.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="smaller">CREMATION AND INHUMATION.</span></h2>
</div>



<p>The discussion of those abnormal cases of after-death existence,
to which the last chapter has been devoted, has disclosed
to us the fact that in all ages of Greece the condition most to be
dreaded by the dead has been incorruptibility and the boon most
to be desired a sure and quick dissolution; and that of the two
methods by which the living might promote the disintegration
of the dead, cremation and inhumation, the former alone has
been accounted infallible. What benefit in the future existence
was in old time thought to accrue to those whose bodies had been
duly dissolved, and to be withheld from <i>revenants</i>, is a question
which may conveniently be adjourned for a while. First we
must verify the results obtained from the study of the abnormal
by consideration of the normal; we must see whether ordinary
funeral usage has had for its sole object the dissolution of the
dead in the interests of the dead; and what, if any, distinction
has been made between inhumation and cremation as a means of
securing that object.</p>

<p>Now diverse methods of disposing of the dead, especially
among a primitive folk, would naturally suggest diverse religious
purposes to be served thereby, diverse conceptions of the future
estate of the dead, or of their future abode, or of their future
relations with the living; and for my part I do not doubt that, if
our eyes could pierce the darkness of a long distant past which
neither history nor even archaeology has illumined, we should
see that the peoples who first used cremation and inhumation
side by side in Greece were in so doing animated by diverse
religious sentiments. But I hold also that in no period of which
we have any cognisance have the Greeks regarded inhumation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span>
and cremation as means to different religious ends; but that,
whichever funeral-method has been employed, one and the same
immediate object has always been kept in view, the dissolution of
the dead body, and one and the same motive (save in the quite
exceptional circumstances where a scare of <i>vrykolakes</i> has temporarily
arisen) has always prompted the mourners thereto, the
motive of benefiting the dead.</p>

<p>But, while the object in view was single and constant, there
would have been no inconsistency in making a certain distinction
between the two methods available. On the contrary, if the sole
object was the disintegration of the dead body, the surer and
quicker means of attaining it should logically have been preferred.
Cremation therefore might legitimately have been reckoned a
superior rite to inhumation; for it cannot but have been recognised
that the disintegration of the body is more rapidly and
unfailingly effected by the action of fire than by the action of
the soil.</p>

<p>It is true indeed that the solvent action of the earth upon
the buried body&mdash;even with all due allowance for the absence of
any coffin in many cases&mdash;is popularly regarded as far more rapid
than it can actually be. The period usually reckoned by the
common-folk as the limit of time requisite for complete dissolution
is forty days. This is stated clearly enough in a few lines of a
song of lamentation heard in Zacynthos:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>‘And within the forty days, they (the dead) are severed joint from joint,

</div>

<p>The Zacynthian muse is horribly explicit; its utterances need
no interpreter; itself rather gives the true interpretation of
certain customs which are wide-spread in modern Greece and
appear to date from pre-Christian days.</p>

<p>The fortieth day after death is almost universally observed in
Greece as one on which the relations of the deceased should
provide a memorial feast. There are indeed other fixed days for
the like commemoration and ‘forgiveness<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a>’ of the dead, but these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span>
all fall at periods of three, or a multiple of three, days, weeks,
months, or years, from the date of death. These, I think, have
been selected in deference to the mysterious virtue of the number
three<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>, and not improbably multiplied by the importunities of a
penurious priesthood, to whom some half-dozen hearty meals in
the course of the year do not appear an inappropriate remuneration
for their services at death-bed and burial. But the fortieth day
was originally devoted to this purpose, it may reasonably be
supposed, because it was the last opportunity of setting before
the dead man’s neighbours and acquaintances savoury meat such
as their soul loved, that they might eat thereof and ‘loose’ the
dead man from any curse wherewith in his lifetime they had
bound him; if dissolution was not to be retarded, the fortieth day
was in popular reckoning the last opportunity for absolution.</p>

<p>From this it should follow that any memorial feasts held later<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a>
than the fortieth day are of purely ecclesiastical contrivance; and
the correctness of this inference is attested by a curious local
usage which clearly distinguishes the popular and the ecclesiastical
feasts. At Sinasos in Asia Minor two classes of commemorations
are recognised. The one is called <span class="greek">κανίσκια</span>, ‘little baskets,’ from
the method in which food is distributed to the poor; this is held
on the fortieth day. The other has usurped the name <span class="greek">μνημόσυνα</span>,
which commonly belongs to all memorial-feasts, and is held on the
three anniversaries of the death (for, after the third, exhumation
generally takes place, and no further memorial-feasts are needed)
and consists in the presentation of an ornamental dish of boiled
wheat (<span class="greek">κόλλυβα</span>) at the church and the reading of a service<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>.
In other words, the fortieth day is the popular festival, and the
observances of later dates are ecclesiastical. Clearly the reason for
this distinction must lie in the fact that the common-folk believe,
as the song from Zacynthos shows, that dissolution is normally
complete by the fortieth day, while the Church has prudently
fixed the date, after which exhumation is permissible, at the end
of the third year. Presumably then a period of forty days was the
old pagan period, for which the Church has tried, with partial
success, to substitute three years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span></p>

<p>Several other small pieces of evidence point to the wide
distribution of this popular notion. In Sinasos<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a>, once more, and
also in Patmos<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>, the fees paid to the priests for memorial services
derive their name from the word ‘forty’ (<span class="greek">σαράντα</span>), as if the
fortieth day were the limit; after that date, apparently, though my
authorities are not explicit on the point, the priests have for their
remuneration only the dish of boiled wheat or other presents in
kind. In Crete, if a dead man is suspected of turning <i>vrykolakas</i>
soon after his death, the people are anxious to deal with him
before he enters upon his second period of forty days<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a>; for then
all hope of natural dissolution is past, and he becomes as it were
a confirmed vampire. In Scyros, the old custom of burning such
corpses as were found on exhumation at the end of three years (or,
in case of a panic, earlier) to be still whole, and were therefore
suspected of vampire-like proclivities, has been replaced by the
milder expedient of carrying the body round to forty churches in
turn and then re-interring it, in the hope, as it seems, that each
of the forty saints, whose sanctuaries have been honoured with a
visit and a certain consumption of candles, will in return take a
proportionate share in ‘loosing’ the suppliant dead&mdash;or, it may
be, in the more mathematical expectation that the work effected
in cases of ordinary burial by one funeral-service in forty days,
will be achieved by forty funeral-services in one day. Whichever
be the calculation on which the practice has been based, the
number of churches to be visited is clearly governed by the
number of days requisite, in popular belief, for ordinary
dissolution.</p>

<p>But with all this reputed rapidity of the earth in ‘loosing’ the
dead bodies committed to her care, the action of fire is incontrovertibly
more rapid. In hours, not in days, may be counted the
period of disintegration on the pyre. And as it is quicker, so also
is it far surer. No body that has been burned can wander as a
<i>revenant</i> over the earth, while for the buried there is no perfect
assurance of dissolution. Some curse, some crime, the violence
of their death, or the deficiency of their funeral rites, each and
all of these may keep their bodies ‘bound’ and indissoluble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span>
Cremation then is indisputably in theory the preferable means
of securing to the dead that boon which they most desire; and I
hold that in the practice of the Greek people there are signs that
this preference was felt.</p>

<p>There are then two propositions to be established by reference
to the actual funeral methods of Ancient and Modern Greece;
first, that from the earliest ages of which we have cognisance
cremation and inhumation have been identical in their religious
purpose; second, that a preference for cremation, considered as a
means to the single religious end, has been manifested.</p>

<p>The first thing needful in this twofold investigation is to
understand the terms, which are to be used, in the sense in
which the Greek understood them. Cremation means to us the
consumption of the corpse by fire; inhumation the laying of the
corpse out of sight in the earth; and unless one or other of those
acts had been really performed, we should not consider that a funeral
had taken place. But the Greeks judged rather by the intention than
by the act. In certain cases, in which the actual digging of a grave
was impossible, ancient usage prescribed a ceremonial substitute.
The sprinkling of a handful of dust over a dead body was held to
constitute burial. Such was all the funeral that Antigone could
give to Polynices<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>; such the minimum of burial enjoined by Attic
Law on any who chanced upon a dead body lying unburied<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>; such,
according to Aelian, ‘the fulfilment of some mysterious law of
piety imposed by Nature’ not only upon man but even on some
of the brute creation, in such sort that the elephant, if he find one
of his own kind dead, gathers up some earth in his trunk and
sprinkles it over the prostrate carcase<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a>. ‘The fulfilment of some
mysterious law of piety’&mdash;Aelian’s phrase accurately summarises
the Greek view of burial. To us it is a necessary and decent
method of disposing of the dead. To the Greeks it was something
more&mdash;a provision for their dimly discerned welfare; and the
intention of the living mattered so much more than the performance,
that, in cases where real burial could not be given, a mere
ceremony suggestive of burial was considered competent to ensure
the same end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[490]</span></p>

<p>Again in the case of a man drowned at sea or having met his
death in any way which precluded the possibility of his body being
brought home for burial, a means has always been found for fulfilling
‘the mysterious law of piety.’ Still, as in old time, the
cenotaph serves the same end as the real sepulchre. A lay-figure,
dressed if possible in some clothes of the dead man, receives on
his behalf the full rite of burial<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>; and if enquiry be made, to what
purpose this empty ceremony, the answer is not slow in coming,
<span class="greek">γιὰ νὰ λυωθῇ ὁ πεθαμένος</span>, ‘to the end that the dead man may be
dissolved’; nor can I doubt that the same formal rite in old time
served the same end.</p>

<p>And let no practical-minded critic here interpose the objection
that a dead body lying unburied, exposed to sun and rain, must
decompose at least as rapidly as one that has been buried; I have
myself tried the effect of that criticism on the Greek peasants
with instructive results. Once my suggestion was promptly met
with a flat and honest denial&mdash;the most simple and final of
answers, for, be it remembered, it is with the honest beliefs of the
peasant, and not with physical facts, that we are dealing. Another
time there was a pause, and then came the deliberate answer,
<span class="greek">βρωμάει τὸ κορμὶ, δὲν λυώνεται</span>, ‘the corpse becomes putrid, but
is not “loosed”.’ There was a distinction in the peasant’s mind
between natural decomposition and the dissolution effected by a
religious rite. But more often it has been pointed out to me
that my apparently reasonable suggestion was really unpractical;
a dead body left unburied would never suffer natural decay, but
would be a prey to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the
air; the vultures circling yonder overhead convicted me of unreason.
And the answer could not but recall the threats of
Achilles against Hector, or the fears of Antigone for Polynices,
that dogs and carrion-birds should feast upon the corpse. So
then it is perhaps a logical as well as an honest belief which the
Greeks have always held, that dissolution of the body is afforded
by one of two rites and by no third means.</p>

<p>Now one of these rites, inhumation, might on occasion be
reduced to a mere ceremonial observance, the scattering of a
handful of dust over the body, or the interment of an effigy in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[491]</span>
stead. Was the other rite, cremation, ever so reduced? Could
the roar and crackle of the blazing pyre be ceremonially replaced
by a small flame lighted in proximity to the dead body? Did the
kindling of a fire, however incapable of consuming the dead body,
constitute cremation in the same sense that a handful of earth,
incapable of concealing the dead body, constituted interment?
<i>Prima facie</i> there is nothing wild in the supposition; it is consistent
with the Greek conception of the funeral-rite, which
looked rather to the intention than to the act; the proven fact of
ceremonial inhumation guarantees the likelihood of ceremonial
cremation. I take it therefore as a working hypothesis, and base
its subsequent claim to be accepted as a fact on its ability to
explain consistently a long series of phenomena in Greek funeral
usage.</p>

<p>My first proposition, that from the earliest ages of which we
have cognisance cremation and inhumation have served the same
religious end, would have had an initial obstacle to surmount but
for Professor Ridgeway’s work on the ethnology of early Greece.
Diverse methods of disposing of the dead would at first sight, as
I have said, suggest diverse conceptions of after-death existence.
But Professor Ridgeway has shown conclusively, to my mind, that
inhumation was the rite of the autochthonous Pelasgian people of
Greece, and that cremation was introduced by the Achaean immigrants<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>.
Now it is improbable of course that these two peoples,
when they first came into contact, held similar views concerning
the hereafter. But the entry of the Achaean element was,
according to all evidence, a long process of infiltration rather than
a sudden invasion. The beginnings of it are conjecturally placed
well back in the third millennium before Christ<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>. There was
ample time therefore, even before the later Mycenaean or the
Homeric age, for differences of religious sentiment as between
the two races to dwindle or to vanish, while the two rites of
cremation and inhumation, with the inveteracy of all custom, still
survived.</p>

<p>Thus there is no initial objection to the view that in any
period known to us those who used cremation and those who
used inhumation were animated by the same religious ideas; and
at the same time I am relieved of the necessity of combating both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span>
the old theory that cremation was adopted by the Greeks as a
convenient substitute for inhumation during some period of
migration or nomadic life, and Rohde’s more recent theory<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> that
fear of the spirits of the dead, which were believed to hover about
graves where their bodies lay buried, led men to adopt cremation
as a means of annihilating the body and thereby ridding themselves
of the unwelcome spirit. Both those theories fail, apart
from certain intrinsic defects, because they are attempts to
explain a thing which never took place&mdash;a supposed substitution
of cremation for inhumation between the Mycenaean and the
Homeric ages. Professor Ridgeway has shown that the Mycenaean
rite was that of the Pelasgians; the Homeric rite that of the
Achaeans. It is an accident only that our earliest information
respecting the two rites happens to be drawn from different
periods of time; the real distinction between the two was a racial
distinction; from the age when the Achaeans first entered Greece
down to the Christian era cremation and inhumation were both
continuously practised.</p>

<p>The positive evidence for my view that these two rites were
mere racial survivals, which had already, in the earliest ages
known to us, ceased to differ in religious import, is to be found
not only in the fact that in historical times, or even earlier, the
two rites were used side by side by the people of a single city
in the same cemetery, but in an early tendency to fuse the two
rites into one and to give to the same body the double treatment
of cremation and inhumation combined; for clearly the
only condition under which two such rites could be amalgamated
must have been that there had ceased to be any conflict of
religious significance between them.</p>

<p>How early this fusion began it is difficult to determine; but it
is at least worth while to note a point which is apt to be overlooked,
that the Homeric funeral-rite comprised inhumation. Cremation
certainly was the main part of the rite, the actual means by which
the corpse was disintegrated; but the funeral was not complete
until the ashes had been collected and inhumed<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>. This is an act of
ceremonial inhumation just as much as the burial of an effigy
dressed in a dead man’s clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span></p>

<p>Moreover it is possible that the Mycenaean funeral-rite sometimes
comprised an act of ceremonial cremation. To review here
the archaeological evidence for some use of fire in Mycenaean
graves is unnecessary; it will suffice to quote from the summary
given by Rohde<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> as the basis of his theory&mdash;to which I by no
means assent&mdash;that a vigorous ‘soul-cult,’ involving propitiatory
offerings to the dead, was a religious feature of that age. ‘Traces
of smoke, remnants of ash and charcoal, point to the fact that the
dead bodies were laid on the spot where were burnt those offerings
to the dead which had previously been made in the tomb.... On
the ground, or sometimes on a specially prepared bed of flints, the
offerings were burnt, and then, when the fire had gone out, the
bodies were laid on top and covered over with sand, lime, and
stones.’</p>

<p>Now the fact that in Mycenaean graves gifts were actually
consumed by fire while the corpse was left to the process of
natural decay is indisputable; but, if the fire employed had no
further purpose, the practice of the Mycenaean age would be
unique. The custom of all later ages was to treat the corpse and
the gifts alike, to burn both or to bury both. This is implied in
ancient literature<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>, and confirmed by modern excavations; for
funeral-urns seldom contain any remnants of gifts; which means
that the gifts had been consumed on the pyre with the body, but
that only the bones were collected and stored in the urn; whereas
in graves the gifts are constantly found buried with the body and
intact. Further the custom of burning both body and gifts is the
old Achaean custom, as described by Homer in the funeral of
Patroclus; and it would seem probable that the custom of interring
both body and gifts intact was the original Pelasgian custom.
Was then the use of fire in these Mycenaean graves the first step
in the fusion of the Achaean and Pelasgian rites?</p>

<p>Again, the body was observed to lie on top of the burnt gifts.
What is the meaning of this superimposition? According to
Rohde the fire which consumed the gifts was allowed to go out,
and the bodies were then laid on the cold ashes. But manifestly
this cannot be proved. All that we know is that the fire did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[494]</span>
consume the bodies. No one can assert that they were untouched
by flame or ember and that the smell of fire did not pass over
them. Was then the act of laying the body on top of the burnt
or burning gifts an act of ceremonial cremation?</p>

<p>These questions I cannot answer; but one thing is clear.
Either the fusion of the Achaean and Pelasgian rites had already
begun, or else, in their original forms, they both comprised usages
which greatly facilitated their subsequent fusion.</p>

<p>When we pass on to the Dipylon-period, there is no longer any
doubt. Cremation and inhumation were practised both severally
side by side and also conjointly as a single rite. The evidence on
which I mainly rely is derived from two series of excavations, those
of Philios<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> at Eleusis and those of Brückner and Pernice<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> in the
Dipylon cemetery at Athens.</p>

<p>The autochthonous population of Attica naturally adhered in
the main to the old Pelasgian rite of inhumation. Yet at Eleusis,
even according to Philios who strangely belittles the importance of
his own discoveries<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>, there was one certain case of cremation;
and in the Dipylon cemetery also was found one urn which could
be dated with equal certainty. One or two other probable cases
have also been recorded by others<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>. Clearly then as early as
the eighth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> cremation was sometimes used, side by
side with inhumation, as the effective means of disintegrating
the dead body.</p>

<p>And there is equally sure proof that the two rites were also
employed conjointly, in the sense that a ceremonial act of inhumation
followed actual cremation, or a ceremonial act of cremation
accompanied actual inhumation. A conspicuous instance of the
former is the one certain case of actual cremation recorded by
Brückner and Pernice<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a>. A bronze urn containing the calcined
bones of a boy or girl had been deposited not in a mere hole dug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[495]</span>
to fit it, but in a grave fully prepared as if for the reception of a
corpse. The measurements of the grave were of normal size; in
it had been laid, along with the urn, gifts of the usual nature&mdash;an
amphora, two boxes, a bowl, and a jug; and above the grave, in
a prepared space considerably wider than the actual grave, stood
one of the large Dipylon-vases. In every respect the interment
had been carried out as if it were the interment of an unburnt
body. An attempt had been made so to combine the two rites of
cremation and inhumation that neither should seem subordinate
to the other.</p>

<p>Instances of the other sort, in which ceremonial cremation
accompanied actual inhumation, are furnished by Philios’ excavations
at Eleusis. Speaking of the large earthenware jars which
often served as coffins for children, he says, ‘Whereas the bones
contained in these vessels were unburnt, all round the vessels in
the soil traces of burning were abundant and varied<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>.’ Now these
traces of fire cannot have been due to the burning of gifts brought
subsequently to the interment; for that custom naturally resulted
in a stratum of burnt soil above the grave. But here the traces
were ‘all round the vessels, in the soil.’ Apparently then we
have here a practice parallel to that of Mycenaean times. The
body was interred and obtained its actual dissolution by natural
decay; but before the interment a fire was kindled in the grave,
and among the flames or on the embers the body in its coffin-jar
was laid and covered over with the soil. Whether at Eleusis, as
at Mycenae, the funeral-gifts were consumed in that fire, we do not
know for certain; but since it is undoubtedly rare to find any gift
along with the child’s body in these vessels, it is reasonable to
suppose that the few gifts&mdash;few, because all the circumstances
of these funerals seem humble&mdash;were burnt<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> just as were the
grander offerings at Mycenae. At any rate these cases reveal an
intention of associating fire with the buried body, of adding to the
rite of interment a ceremonial act of cremation.</p>

<p>The tendency towards fusion of the two funeral rites has now
been traced through the pre-historic era; it is in the historic period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[496]</span>
that the fusion appears most general and most complete. I will
take as typical instances a number of graves, ranging in date from
the sixth to the fourth century, opened by the two German
excavators on whose narrative I have largely relied for the Dipylon-period<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a>.
These graves numbered somewhat under two hundred.
In the classification of them there appears the important
item&mdash;forty-five graves in which the body had been actually
burned. In other words, in approximately a quarter of the cases
observed the rites of cremation and inhumation had been combined,
and that too in such a way that both elements, fire and earth,
might well have seemed to share together the work of dissolution.
Neither method is here exalted to sole efficacy, neither is degraded
into mere ceremony. The balance of importance is adjusted, and
the two acts which form the composite funeral-rite are recognised
as equal. Indeed there are no longer two distinct acts; they have
coalesced; the moment and the act of laying the body in the
earth are also the moment and the act of laying the body on the
pyre. Amalgamation is complete.</p>

<p>Having traced the history of Greek funeral-usage down to this
point, I may now fairly claim, first, that my working hypothesis&mdash;the
practice of ceremonial cremation as the counterpart of ceremonial
inhumation&mdash;is justified by the single and consistent
explanation which it affords of the phenomena which I have
noticed (and I may add that I shall have occasion to explain other
phenomena in the latter half of this chapter in the same way);
secondly, if that explanation be accepted, I may claim that the only
condition under which the two rites could have been employed
both severally as alternatives and conjointly as one composite rite
was that the religious purpose underlying them both was one and
the same. And this purpose, if there is any meaning in the
stories of Patroclus, Elpenor, Polynices, and Polydorus, was to give
to the dead that which they most craved, a speedy dissolution.</p>

<p>The evidence for this unity of purpose is, I hope, already
sufficient; but confirmation may be found, if required, in the
smaller details of funeral-custom. It is, I believe, a received
principle of textual criticism that, in estimating the relation of
two manuscripts of a given author, coincidence in <i>minutiae</i> is the
true criterion of their common origin or other close kinship, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[497]</span>
its testimony is not to be outweighed by a few conspicuous
divergences. So too, I think, in estimating the mutual relation
of two rites, the coincidence of all the minor circumstances connected
with them is of more significance than one large and
evident contrast between them. Such a contrast, let it be granted,
exists between cremation and inhumation when employed separately.
Yet it would be a rash and faulty judgement, I hold, which
should at once infer thence that the two rites were informed by
different religious ideas. The minute coincidences claim examination.
If all that preceded and accompanied and followed the
actual disposal of the corpse, whether by burning or by burial,
exhibited uniformity in scheme and in scope; if the washing and
the anointing, the arraying and the crowning, were performed with
the same tender care whether the body was destined for the cold,
slow earth or for the rapid flame; if from the death-chamber,
where the body had lain in state and the kinsfolk, grouped in
order of dearness about it, had paid in turn their debt of lamentation,
the same sad pomp escorted the dead whether to the pyre or
to the grave; if the same gifts&mdash;the same provision as it seems
for bodily comfort&mdash;were mingled as ashes with the ashes of the
dead or were consigned intact with the body yet intact to the will
and keeping of the earth; then, whichever means the mourners
chose for effecting the actual dissolution of the fleshly remains,
their religious attitude towards death and their conception of the
hereafter must have been single and constant.</p>

<p>Space forbids me to enter into the evidence for the uniformity
of all this detail in all periods of Greek life. I will confine myself
to two illustrations. The first shall be the <i>prothesis</i> or lying-in-state
of the body with the solemn lamentation of the kinsfolk, for
the most part women, grouped about it. I have elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a>
described the scene; I have only to illustrate here the universality
of it as the prelude alike to cremation and to inhumation, alike
in Ancient and in Modern Greece, alike amid pagan and amid
Christian surroundings. In the Mycenaean age the bodies of the
dead were sumptuously arrayed&mdash;probably with a view to the lying-in-state;
more than that cannot be actually asserted of the earliest
epoch. But in the Homeric age, as at the funeral of Hector<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>, the
custom is seen already fully developed. In the Dipylon-age the scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[498]</span>
described by Homer is found depicted on the great vases that
served as monuments over the graves<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a>. A little later, the legislation
of Solon is directed against the excesses to which the rite of
solemn lamentation led<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>. Next, an orator of Athens is found
declaiming against the wrongs done to him by the thirty tyrants,
who, not content with having put his brother to death, had actually
refused the use of any of the three houses belonging to the family
and had forced them to lay out the body in a hired hut<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>. Again
we have the ridicule of Lucian directed against the discordant
scene of useless misery<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a>. In strange company with him appears
St Chrysostom upbraiding Christians for their extravagances of
grief and threatening them with excommunication if they continue
to call in heathen women to act as professional mourners<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a>. Centuries
passed without diminution of the custom, and the Venetians
during their occupation of the Ionian islands enacted laws<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> in
the spirit of those formulated by Solon more than two thousand
years before. Of this custom it might well be said, ‘<i>et vetabitur
semper et retinebitur</i>,’ for it still maintains its old vogue and
vitality, and is the necessary prelude of every peasant’s funeral
to-day.</p>

<p>My second illustration is a far more trivial circumstance, but
not on that account less significant&mdash;the use of the foliage of the
olive as a couch for the dead, whether on the bier which conveyed
him to the grave or on the funeral-pyre. The reason for choosing
olive-leaves does not concern us; there may have been, as Rohde
suggests<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>, some idea of purification connected with it; but it is
only the wide-spread use of it which I have to illustrate. Among
the ashes of those small pyres, on which the dead were laid in
Mycenaean sepulchres, were recognised charred olive-leaves<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a>.
Lycurgus in curtailing the funeral-rites of Sparta bade his countrymen
wrap their dead for burial in the red military cloak (as became
a race of warriors) and in olive-leaves<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a>. The Pythagoreans, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span>
objected to cremation<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>, laid their dead to rest on a bed of leaves
gathered from myrtle, poplar, and olive<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a>. An Attic law forbade the
felling of certain olive-trees under penalty of a fine of a hundred
drachmae per tree, but contained a saving-clause exempting cases
in which olive-wood was wanted for funerals<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>. This permission
points to a special use of olive-wood as fuel for the pyre, for, if a
few branches or sprays only had been needed for decking out the
bier, there would have been no question of felling whole trees. It
was probably then this custom which Sophocles also had in
mind, when the messenger, who brought the news of Polynices’
tardy funeral, was made by him to specify ‘fresh-plucked olive-shoots’
as the material of the pyre<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>. Again, in a number of
sarcophagi found by Fauvel outside the gates of Athens on the
road to Acharnae the skeleton was observed to lie ‘on a thick bed
of olive-leaves<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>.’ In the second century of our era the custom of
placing olive-branches on the bier still prevailed<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>; and at the
present day the olive is often conspicuous at the funerals of
peasants, either in the garland about the dead man’s head or in
the decoration of the bier.</p>

<p>Thus the uniformity of detail in funerals, whether the main
rite was cremation or inhumation, no less than the tendency to
amalgamate these two into a single rite, proves that, from the
earliest ages known to us, their religious purpose had been
identical&mdash;to give to the dead that speedy bodily dissolution which
they desired.</p>

<p>But in spite of this unity of purpose, one or other rite doubtless
continued long through force of custom to hold predominance
in particular districts. In Attica it was perhaps not until the
sixth or even the fifth century that the Pelasgian rite had entirely
lost the support of ancestral tradition. But then and thenceforward
the two methods appear to have been judged simply as
methods, and the estimate of their respective merits was little
affected by the old racial differences. But this does not mean that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span>
the methods were judged wholly on their religious merits&mdash;on
their adaptability to the single religious purpose. Cost and convenience
were necessarily factors in determining the choice between
them. Thus the question of cost must often have decided the
poorer classes to choose inhumation; and in that portion of the
Dipylon cemetery to which I have already referred, it was actually
found that, out of the graves in which no evidence of cremation
was found, more than a hundred were of a poor character, mere
shafts in the earth, or at the best walled with rough brick-built
sides, while only thirteen were of a costly style&mdash;sepulchres built
with slabs of stone, or regular sarcophagi. And similarly other
practical considerations must often have turned the scale in favour
of the one or the other rite. The soldiers who fell at Marathon
were simply interred, presumably because to dig a trench and to
raise a mound in the middle of the plain was a more feasible task
than to collect masses of fuel from the surrounding hill-sides; but
the victims of the plague at Athens were with good reason
cremated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, where none of these external causes operated,
there are signs that cremation was held in somewhat higher
esteem than inhumation. The story went that Solon’s body was
burnt, by way of honour seemingly, and his ashes scattered over
that island which he had won back for Athens. And we hear of
cremation being accorded, apparently again as the more honourable
rite, to other great men such as Dionysius, the famous tyrant
of Syracuse, and Timoleon, her deliverer. But more conclusive
is the evidence of literature, where not only the act itself
is named, but a clear indication of the feeling of the actors
is given. According to Aeschylus, the dead body of Agamemnon,
king though he was, was merely hidden away in the ground by
his blood-guilty wife; even in death she would show him no
pity, do him no honour. But in Sophocles the dying Heracles
is laid on a funeral-pyre, and the dead Polynices, to whom
Antigone was perforce content to give the most meagre form
of interment, obtains from Creon, when at last too late he repents,
the full rite of cremation. And the tone too in which
Herodotus once speaks of the two rites is significant: ‘the funeral-rites
of well-to-do Thracians,’ he says, ‘are as follows: the body
lies in state for three days, and they slaughter all manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[501]</span>
victims and make good cheer, when once the preliminary lamentation
is done; and then they dispose of the body by cremation or
merely by interment’&mdash;<span class="greek">ἔπειτα δὲ θάπτουσι κατακαύσαντες, ἢ
ἄλλως γῇ κρύψαντες</span><a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a>. The ‘merely’ plainly betrays Herodotus’
own feeling that well-to-do persons might be expected to have the
advantage of cremation.</p>

<p>In the following centuries the preference for cremation would
seem to have become even more pronounced; for though both
rites still continued in use, separately as well as conjointly, Lucian
was able to call cremation the distinctively Hellenic rite<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>. But
more marked still was the feeling in favour of cremation among
those who upheld the old Greek religion when first they had to
face the invasion of Christianity. ‘The heathen for the most
part,’ says Bingham<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>, ‘burned the bodies of the dead in funeral
piles, and then gathered up the bones and ashes, and put them in
an urn above ground: but the Christians abhorred this way of
burying; and therefore never used it, but put the body whole into
the ground.’ The conflict over this matter was bitter. The
pagans taunted the Christians with fearing that, if their bodies
were reduced to ashes by cremation, they would be incapacitated
for the vaunted resurrection<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>, and as a final injury to Christian
martyrs sometimes burnt their bodies and scattered the ashes to
the winds<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>. The Christians in retaliation condemned the rite of
cremation as in appearance an act of cruelty to the dead body<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a>,
and ridiculed the pagans for first ‘burning up their dead in a
most savage manner and then feasting them in a manner most
gluttonous, using the flames alike for their service and for their
injury<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>’&mdash;for their service in cooking them a funeral-meal, for
their injury in consuming them to ashes. The two now conflicting
rites continued in use until the end of the fourth century of our
era; for reference is made to them in the laws of Theodosius<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a>. But
cremation must have been on the decrease; for Macrobius early in
the fifth century says that in his time the practice had fallen into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[502]</span>
entire desuetude, and all he knew of it was from reading<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a>. ‘It is
most probable,’ says Bingham, ‘that the heathen custom altered
by degrees from the time of Commodus the Emperor; for Commodus
himself and many of his friends were buried by inhumation
and not by burning ... and from that time the custom of burning
might decrease till at last under the Christian emperors, though
without any law to forbid it, the contrary custom entirely prevailed,
and this quite dwindled into nothing.’ If this view be correct, it
will mean that the old preference for cremation exhibited by the
adherents of paganism was only excited to temporary intensity
by a spirit of antagonism towards Christianity, and that they
soon returned to the old way of thinking and recognised inhumation
as a method alternative, if slightly inferior, to cremation.
When the bitterness of religious strife was over, and pagans
and Christians lived more at peace together, the former may
readily have resumed the practice of interment, which after all
was their own heritage from dim ages long before the dawn of
Christianity.</p>

<p>But though Macrobius in the fifth century speaks of cremation
as then in disuse, the memory of it cannot have passed away so
soon. Only a few generations were to lapse before the infusion of
a Slavonic population into Greece. Among the superstitions
which these intruders disseminated was one which concerned the
resuscitated dead. The Greeks, as we have seen, themselves held
a superstition on which the horrid imaginings of the Slavs were
soon grafted; the common-folk became haunted by the dread of
<i>vrykolakes</i>. How then did they deal with the bodies of such dead
persons as were suspected? Not by adopting the Slavonic custom
of impaling them, but by a revival of cremation. The advantage
which that rite possessed over burial was remembered; by its aid
the dissolution of the dead could be rendered quick and sure.
Thus cremation came once more into use as a means to the same
end as in old time&mdash;the quick dissolution of the dead body; but
the motive for promoting that dissolution was, under the altered
conditions, itself altered. Instead of love it was fear; instead of
solicitude for the welfare of the dead, it was anxiety for the protection
of the living.</p>

<p>Yet even so, the act of burning the <i>vrykolakas</i> was a purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span>
defensive, not an offensive, measure. It was not an act of hostility
or reprisal, but merely a necessary act of self-preservation, which
inflicted no hurt on the <i>revenant</i> but simply interposed an impassable
barrier between the living and the dead. The motive
was fear; there was little or nothing of hatred mixed with it.
This is made clear by the fact that cremation has been used even
in recent times in a case which had nothing whatsoever to do with
the belief in <i>vrykolakes</i>, and where the sole motive was the old
desire to serve the interests of the dead.</p>

<p>The occasion was the evacuation of Parga in 1819. The
inhabitants of that town had long defied the Turks, but the end
was at hand, and it was only by the intervention of the English
that they were saved from the tender mercies of Ali Pasha. The
English offered them asylum in the Ionian Islands and obtained
from the Porte on their behalf a sum of money which fully indemnified
them for the houses and lands which they abandoned.
But in spite of the terms obtained, the emigrants never forgave
the English for treacherously selling to the Turks, as they said, the
home which they had defended so stoutly and so long<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a>. This
evacuation of Parga forms the theme of some ballads which have
been preserved<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>. One of them runs as follows:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[504]</span></p>

<p>The incident in this ballad with which we are concerned is the
exhumation and burning of the remains of those dead warriors who
had valiantly maintained the liberty of their native town; and
there need be little doubt that the incident is actually historical,
for the story is confirmed by a second ballad in the same collection<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>;
but in any case all that concerns us here is the fact that
the motive for such an act was known and appreciated by the
authors of the two ballads.</p>

<p>Now in order to understand this motive, it must be remembered
that the general custom of the Church in Greece is to
exhume the bones of the dead at the expiration of three years
from the time of burial, when dissolution is expected to be complete.
Hence the kinsfolk for whose remains the men of Parga
were concerned were those who had been recently buried and
could not yet have attained complete dissolution. They feared
that the Turks would disturb and desecrate the graves and thus
obstruct the proper course of natural decay; and they therefore
decided to adopt the alternative method of disintegration, and by
cremation to effect speedily and surely that end which, without
friends at hand to guard the graves from the molestation of foes
and infidels, could not be secured by leaving the dead to the slow
action of the earth. This decision then reveals a clear recognition
of the superiority of cremation over inhumation as a means of
compassing the final dissolution of the dead; and equally clear is
the motive for seeking that end; it was not fear on their own
account&mdash;to that feeling indeed the men of Parga had proved
themselves strangers&mdash;but simply love and respect for the brave
men who had fought, and perhaps had fallen, in the defence of
freedom.</p>

<p>Since then the exhumation and cremation of the dead constituted
in this case an act of love towards them, the same action
in the case of suspected <i>vrykolakes</i> can never have been an act of
hostility. It was rather a measure beneficial alike to the living
and to the dead. To the living it gave immunity from the
assaults of <i>vrykolakes</i>, and this without doubt was commonly the
uppermost or indeed the only thought in the minds of those who
had recourse to it; but to the dead too it gave repose. And
indeed I cannot but suppose that this is the reason why the
Greeks, when first confronted with the horror of <i>vrykolakes</i>, chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[505]</span>
to burn them rather than to follow the Slavonic custom of impaling
them. To impale them might have given security to the living,
but it appeared as an act of cruelty and hostility against the dead.
Cremation, by effecting immediate dissolution and the consequent
severance of the dead from this world, was bound to give equal
security to the living, and at the same time was an act of mercy
and kindness to the dead. In effect, the new motive of dread
which came along with Slavonic influence never excluded the old
motive of love which inspired the sons of warriors at Parga no less
than the chief of Homeric warriors at his comrade’s funeral, and
perhaps will, if occasion arise, prove itself not yet extinct. Cremation,
though often in recent times employed primarily as a safeguard
for the living, has all along been felt to confer also a benefit
on the dead, an even surer and speedier benefit than inhumation
secured.</p>

<p>Now if this feeling existed, and if there existed also from early
times, as I have shown to be probable, a system of combining
cremation of a ceremonial kind with actual inhumation, it might
reasonably be expected that many who recognised the superior
merit of cremation, but had not the means to carry out so costly a
rite in full, would have availed themselves of the inexpensive
ceremonial practice. This, I believe, is what occurred, and in this
I shall seek the explanation of a custom which, like the practice
of real cremation, has been bequeathed by Ancient to Modern
Greece.</p>

<p>In the funerals of Ancient Greece the procession, which escorted
the dead body from the room where it had lain in state to the
pyre or the grave, carried torches. Where cremation was to be
employed, these were doubtless used for kindling the pyre; the
fire brought from the dead man’s home in this world was used to
speed him on his way to the next. But when inhumation was practised,
what became of these torches? Was the fire brought from
the dead man’s home put to no purpose? Or were the torches
thrown into the grave along with him? That we cannot tell, for
the torches were quickly perishable. But there is one object
commonly found in tombs which is suggestive of the association of
fire with the buried body. That common object is a lamp. Here
again we cannot tell whether that lamp was lighted when it was
put in the grave. Some that have been dug up have certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[506]</span>
been in use, for they bear marks of the flame; but of course they
may have been in every-day use before they were devoted to the
service of the dead. Yet the few facts known would at least fit
the theory that the procession which carried out the dead man
carried also fire from his home to the grave, and that either the
torches themselves or a lamp lighted from them was put in the
grave beside the body. If that view were correct, it would further
be note-worthy that most of the lamps found are of little intrinsic
value and of late date<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>. Now the fact that they are mostly worthless
implies that they were often given by poor persons, or, if the
other contents of the grave be of value, that the lamp was not
brought as a gift for its intrinsic worth or beauty, but for some
practical purpose; while the fact that they are mainly of late date
means that the practice of putting them in the graves increased in
frequency during the period which begins with the fifth century
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;that is to say, during that period in which we have already
noted an increasing preference for cremation. Further the increase
in the frequency of lamps makes it improbable that they are to
be reckoned as part and parcel of the ordinary furniture of a grave;
for the <i>lekythi</i> and other vases which were the ordinary gifts to
the dead had already in the fifth century assumed a conventional
character. Any fresh departure therefore after that century, or
any increase in the frequency of one particular object among the
contents of graves, must be a sign of some new or more strongly
marked feeling towards the dead. Now all these facts and
inferences are intelligible on one hypothesis; and that hypothesis
is that the lamps found in the graves were put there lighted and
burning, as the ceremonial minimum of the rite of cremation for
which a growing preference is evident during some four centuries
before the Christian era.</p>

<p>When we pass on to the early days of Christianity, a similar
series of facts meets our view. The Church officially rejected and
reprobated the practice of cremation. Converts therefore were
bound to use inhumation; and this obligation probably excited
the less repugnance, in that interment was no new thing to them,
but had always been alternative, if slightly inferior, to cremation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[507]</span>
But while even cheerfully obeying the law of the Church thus
far, they clung to many of the details of their old funeral-custom,
some of which were allowed by the Church, others disallowed.
The practice of laying out the dead in rich and choice robes continued
and called down strong rebuke from St Jerome<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>; the
excessive lamentation and the use of hired mourners at the lying-in-state
provoked St Chrysostom to threats of excommunication<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>;
yet both these customs still obtain. But the custom of carrying
torches in the funeral-procession was continued without even a
protest on the part of the Church. Perhaps it was felt to be a
harmless concession to ancient custom; perhaps then as now
ecclesiastical taste even favoured the consumption of many candles
in religious ceremonies. At any rate the fact is clear that the
pagan custom of carrying torches in the procession held a place
also in Christian ritual. What was the reason for which the
common people held to their old custom? The torches were not
needed any longer to kindle pyres; for actual cremation was
abolished by the Church. Nor were they needed to give light to
the procession; for Christian funerals, except in times of persecution,
took place in open daylight. The reason was, I believe, that
by means of these torches fire was carried along with the dead
from his home to his grave, and that there a ceremonial act, a
semblance of cremation, was combined with the rite of inhumation.
And there are some indications that the fire brought to the grave-side
was actually associated in some way with the dead body. In
a disquisition ‘about them that sleep,’ which passed for a work of
St Athanasius<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a>, there is a recommendation to burn a mixture of
oil and wax at the grave of the dead; and though the practice
inculcated is disguised as ‘a sacrifice of burnt-offering to God,’ it
is possible to attribute it to a less Jewish and more Greek motive,
a desire to keep up the old custom of cremation, be it only in a
ceremonial form. Again we have evidence that the custom of
burning lights at the graves of the dead was commonly followed
for some non-Christian purpose; for the Council of Eliberis saw
fit to forbid it under pain of excommunication<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>. This non-Christian
purpose will explain itself in the light of some modern customs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[508]</span></p>

<p>There is a custom well known in Modern Greece which consists
in the maintenance of what is called ‘the unsleeping lamp’
(<span class="greek">τὸ ἀκοίμητο καντῆλι</span>). A fair general idea of it may be given by
saying that after a funeral a light is kept continuously burning
either in the room where death took place or at the grave for a
period of either forty days or three years. This variation in
time and place requires examination. In customs, as in other
things, there is a right way and a wrong way; variety in observance
is not original; there is a proper time and a proper place.</p>

<p>First then, which is the proper place for this particular custom,
the chamber of death or the grave-side?</p>

<p>The localities, in which that form of the custom which I
shall show to be correct in this particular has come most conspicuously
under my own observation, are Aráchova, a village near
Delphi; Leonídi on the east coast of Laconia; a cemetery in the
Thriasian plain belonging, I think, to the village of Kalývia; and
the island of Aegina. In the last-mentioned it is an ordinary
lantern which is used; it is placed at the head of the grave, and
for forty days after the funeral is so trimmed and tended that the
flame is not once extinguished. At Aráchova and in the Thriasian
plain each grave is provided with an erection capable of sheltering
a naked light. Some of the erections are like doll’s-houses with
door and windows complete; others are mere boxes; others again
are no more than a few tiles or flat stones set on edge to form a
square and covered over with a roof of the same material. At
Aráchova the lamps contained in these erections are tended both
evening and morning, and the obligation to keep them burning
uninterruptedly for three years, until the exhumation of the body,
is strongly felt and scrupulously discharged. In the Thriasian
plain the light is kept burning with equal care, but I am uncertain
for what period. At Leonídi some shelters of the same kind as
those described are in use; but there are also more elaborate
tombs at the head of which is built a small recess below the level
of the ground or at any rate under the slab of stone or marble
which covers the grave, and in this recess, which is closed with a
small door allowing the passage of air through its chinks, is placed
‘the unsleeping lamp.’ Here again the lights are kept burning
until the exhumation takes place, and the lamps are fed and
trimmed every evening. At Gytheion a device not dissimilar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[509]</span>
though ruder, was formerly employed; among some old graves,
now neglected, from which, it appeared, the bones of the dead had
never been exhumed, I noticed several plastered over with a rough
concrete in which was sunk at the head of the grave an iron
vessel, like a sauce-pan docked of its handle; this vessel had
presumably served the purpose of sheltering a light.</p>

<p>Such then is the main aspect of this custom; but the preliminary
details also require notice. The fire with which to light
the ‘unsleeping lamp’ must not be kindled on the spot beside the
grave, but is conveyed from the house of the deceased. There, in
general, the moment that death takes place or at any rate so soon
as the body is laid out in state, candles or lamps are lighted and
are placed at the head and at the foot of the couch on which the
body reposes. These are kept burning until the funeral-procession
is ready to start, and along with the procession either the same
lights or other tapers and candles lighted from them are carried to
the grave; and here the same fire which was burning in the house
of the dead is transmitted to the ‘unsleeping lamp’ at the grave.</p>

<p>This I believe to be the correct form of the custom, but
I must notice other varieties and give my reasons for regarding
them as less authentic. It is stated in a reliable treatise on
the island of Chios<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>, that there the people keep a lamp burning
for forty nights in the room where a death has taken place,
thinking that the soul wanders for forty nights before it goes down
to Hades. The interpretation given evidently implies that the
lamp is intended to give light to the spirit of the dead if in the
course of its nightly wanderings it visits its former home.</p>

<p>Now so far as the Chian form of the custom is concerned, some
such meaning might reasonably be assigned to it. But what of
the more usual form of the custom by which the lamp is kept
burning both night and day? A disembodied spirit, if it resemble
an ordinary man, may reasonably be supposed to need a candle to
see its way at night, but surely it needs none in the day-time;
yet it is only the custom of burning the light all day long as
well as at night that can have gained for it the name of
‘the unsleeping lamp,’ the lamp that is never extinguished. Here
then is a visible defect in the Chian manner of observing the
custom and likewise in the Chian manner of interpreting it; and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[510]</span>
custom defective and misinterpreted in one important detail is open
to suspicion in others. So far therefore as Chios is concerned, no
great importance attaches to the fact that there the chamber of
death is the place where the remnants of the custom are observed.</p>

<p>But there are other parts of Greece in which the death-chamber
is the place for the ‘unsleeping lamp,’ and where the lamp
still deserves that designation inasmuch as it is kept burning
both day and night until the fortieth day after the funeral, and is
not, as in Chios, lighted afresh each night. In such districts, I
believe, the custom has long ceased to bear any meaning, and
being on the wane has for convenience undergone a change. It
is still felt to be obligatory to keep the flame that is lighted as
soon as death has occurred burning constantly for forty days, but
the work of tending it has been found to be more conveniently
performed at home than in the grave-yard. The necessity to
transmit the flame to the grave, to keep it continuously in close
proximity to the dead, is no longer felt. This form of the custom
can then be accounted for as a relaxation of that which I have put
forward as the old and correct form; whereas on the other hand if
the room where death occurred had originally been the proper
place for maintaining the ‘unsleeping lamp,’ it would be impossible
to account for the transference of the custom to the grave-side,
where special shelters or receptacles must be made for the protection
of the flame and where more trouble is needed to feed and to
trim the lamps day by day. Aráchova and Leonídi where most
pains are taken in the observance of the custom&mdash;and that not for
forty days only but for three years&mdash;have the best claim to be
regarded as the true exponents of the old custom. The proper
place for the ‘unsleeping lamp’ is the grave-side.</p>

<p>But there is a variation also, as I have said, in the period of
time during which this custom is kept up in different districts. In
some it is a period of forty days, in others a period of three years;
and in this respect there is a divergence between the usages even
of those places which in other details have been shown to adhere
faithfully to the old custom; for at Aráchova and Leonídi the longer
period is customary, in Aegina the shorter. It is in this very
variation that we find a clue to the meaning and purpose of the
custom. In the earlier part of this chapter I showed, by quotation
from a popular dirge and by the consideration of various customs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[511]</span>
connected with death, that in the belief of the common-folk the
dissolution of a dead body is effected by the fortieth day after
burial. On the other hand the Church has more prudently fixed
three years as the time required for dissolution, the period which
must elapse before the body may be exhumed. Thus there are
two periods, fixed respectively by popular opinion and by ecclesiastical
authority, between which there is a choice; the <i>vox populi</i>
and the <i>vox Dei</i> are here in disagreement; and according as
preference is locally given to the one or to the other mandate, so
is a period of forty days or a period of three years locally believed
to be that required for the dissolution of the body. But these
two periods are also those between which there is a local variation
in the custom of maintaining the ‘unsleeping lamp.’ Hence
it is reasonably to be inferred that the ‘unsleeping lamp’ is in
some way closely connected with the dissolution of the body.</p>

<p>Moreover this connexion is actually recognised by the common-folk
themselves, as witness the following two couplets from a
funeral-dirge. The words are put, as so often in the dirges, in
the mouth of the dead man, who in this instance is supposed
to be young and to be addressing his forlorn lady-love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘And when the priests with solemn song march toward the grave with me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steal thou out from thy mother’s side and light me torches three;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the priests shall quench again those lights for me,&mdash;ah then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, like the breath of roses, sweet, thou passest from my ken<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines are based on a belief which is fairly general among
the Greek peasants, that consciousness of, and concern for, the
things of this world are not broken off finally at the moment
of death, but continue in some degree until the body of the dead is
completely dissolved. Here the memories of love are spoken of as
lasting until the priests quench the burning lights, which can be
none other in the context than the ‘unsleeping lamp’&mdash;for three,
the number mentioned, is merely a number of peculiar virtue and
has no special force. It follows then that the quenching of
the lights is understood in the passage to denote the accomplish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[512]</span>ment
of that process of dissolution, which, though it mean the
cessation of all intercourse with this upper world, is yet earnestly
desired. Here in fact are plain words of popular poetry which
recognise the connexion of the ‘unsleeping lamp’ with the dissolution
of the body, and make the quenching of the one signify
the completion of the other. It is going but a short step further
to suppose that the presence of the lamp’s flame at the grave was
originally intended to advance the process of dissolution&mdash;or, in
other words, that the maintenance of the ‘unsleeping lamp’ at the
grave until the body is finally dissolved is an act of ceremonial
cremation.</p>

<p>This supposition gains yet more in probability when we
compare with the custom of the ‘unsleeping lamp’ another not
dissimilar custom which obtains in Zacynthos. There, as elsewhere,
candles or lamps are lighted about the dead body while it
is lying in state, and fire from them is carried to the grave. But,
arrived there, instead of lighting an ‘unsleeping lamp,’ the bearers
of the candles drop them into the grave beside the corpse. In
this we have a close parallel to the ancient custom of putting a
lamp, probably enough, as I have suggested, a lighted lamp, into
the grave; and at the same time it cannot but be intimately connected
with the custom of the ‘unsleeping lamp,’ the purpose of
which is now known to concern the dissolution of the dead body.
I claim then that the series of customs which we have reviewed,
exhibiting as they do an intention to associate fire in some close
way with the buried body and, as in the modern form of the custom,
to associate it therewith until the process of dissolution is complete,
find a common explanation in the continuance of a practice
already exemplified in earlier ages, the practice of ceremonial
cremation in conjunction with the full burial rite.</p>

<p>Nor is this explanation open to attack on the ground that a
mere lamp lighted near the dead body bears so little outward
resemblance to real cremation. To the outside observer the
ceremonial act may seem a mere travesty of that for which it is
substituted; but to the persons concerned the presence of fire, in
however small a volume, may have seemed sufficient; for in all
ritual it is not the act, but the intention, which has value. I have
already pointed out how interment was occasionally reduced to an
equally ineffective minimum; but I may perhaps cite a still closer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[513]</span>
parallel&mdash;another case in which a lamp is thought to have done
duty for a real fire. There was in old time a custom, to which
several ancient writers refer<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>, of keeping a lamp burning both day
and night in the Prytaneum or in the chief temple of a Greek
city; and both Athens and Tarentum are said to have had these
lamps so constructed that they could hold a supply of oil sufficient
to last a whole year. Such lamps, it has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>, represented
the fire on the city’s hearth which was not allowed to go
out. The purpose of the lamp was clearly not to give light&mdash;for
then it need not have been kept burning by day as well as by night&mdash;but
it was a labour-saving appliance for keeping the sacred fire
ever burning. The small flame was in fact a rudimentary fire. Thus
all that I am supposing is that a lamp could represent a real
fire just as well at the tomb as in the Prytaneum.</p>

<p>If then my explanation of the modern custom is right, the fact
that the common-folk, though they have for many centuries
employed inhumation as the ordinary Christian rite, have clung at
the same time to a ceremonial form of cremation which they still
connect in some way with the dissolution of the buried corpse, is
additional proof of the favour with which the quicker and surer
rite was formerly, and perhaps here and there still is, regarded.</p>

<p>Thus then the study of ordinary funeral-usage has confirmed
the conclusions drawn in preceding chapters from the study of a
certain abnormal state of after-death existence. As incorruptibility
was the greatest bane to the dead, so dissolution was the greatest
boon that the living could give them. This dissolution was to be
effected by one of two methods, cremation and inhumation, which
in theory were alternative but in practice were frequently combined.
The combination of them was due in the first instance to
the amalgamation of two races to which they respectively appertained;
but in later times the racial difference between the two
rites was obliterated, and they were judged on their own merits,
with the result that a preference for cremation manifested itself
in funeral-usage. This preference was due to a recognition that
cremation was a quicker and surer method of dissolution, and is
itself strong testimony to the desire to effect dissolution. The end
to which both rites were directed was the same, but since one led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[514]</span>
to that end more quickly and surely than the other, it was rightly
preferred.</p>

<p>Further the motive which prompted the living to effect the dissolution
of the dead was not in general selfish; for dissolution, as we
have seen, was a boon to the dead. That complete severance from
this world, which came with the dissolution of the body, was in
some way for the benefit of the dead. Patroclus sought for it, and
Achilles granted his petition through love; and some three
thousand years later the men of Parga are found effecting the
rapid dissolution of their kinsfolk with the same motive. Only in
one set of circumstances was the selfish motive of fear in operation,
namely, where, the resuscitated dead were, by the influence of
Slavonic superstition, invested with the character of malignant
blood-thirsty monsters against whom self-defence was imperative,
and whose complete severance from this world was desirable as a
safeguard for the living. But such circumstances were the exception.
The rule was that cremation and inhumation alike were
means to the dissolution of the dead and their complete severance
from this world, and the motive which prompted living men to
seek that end was love of the dead who would in some way benefit
thereby.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE BENEFIT OF DISSOLUTION.</span></h2>
</div>



<p>Thus far the investigation of customs and beliefs in ancient
and modern times relating to the treatment of the dead has
established the fact that the dissolution of the body was a
thing eagerly to be desired in the interests of the dead. With
complete disintegration the <i>summum bonum</i> of the dead, so far as
it was in the power of their surviving friends to win it for them,
was secured. It remains to consider in what way the dead profited
thereby.</p>

<p>Now I have hitherto spoken designedly of dissolution as a
benefit, not to the souls of the dead nor to their bodies, but simply
‘to the dead’ without further specification. It will now limit the
range of discussion as to the nature of the <i>summum bonum</i> to
which dissolution gave access, if we can first answer the old
question, <i>cui bono?</i> Is it the body alone or the soul alone or both
conjointly on which the benefit is conferred? This question once
answered, we shall have eliminated a certain number of possible
conceptions of future happiness.</p>

<p>That the body alone might have been the recipient of the
whole benefit is an idea which no one will entertain. Was it
then the soul alone to which the dissolution of the body brought
gain? Death, as we have learnt, was not a complete and final
severance of soul from body; the soul might re-enter and re-animate
the corpse. Was dissolution then believed to complete
the severance?</p>

<p>The deliverance of the soul from the bondage of the body, the
divorce of spirit from matter, is an idea which has appealed and
does appeal to many, and would therefore furnish a motive of considerable
intrinsic probability for the treatment which the Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[516]</span>
people have consistently accorded to their dead; the dissolution of
the body, it might be supposed, was desired and hastened in order
that the soul might be freed from its last link with this material
world and pass away winged and unburdened towards things
ethereal.</p>

<p>But such an explanation savours too much of philosophy and
too little of popular religion. ‘The rehearsal of death,’ that is of
the severance of soul from body, was according to Socrates the
proper occupation of the philosopher; and death itself was welcome
to him as a final release of the soul, the true self, from the fetters of
physical existence. But the very emphasis which the whole of the
<i>Phaedo</i> gives to this idea, the insistence of Socrates that his real
self is that which converses with his friends and seeks to convince
them of his views, and not the corpse which they will soon be
burying or burning as seemeth them good<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a>, suggest, if anything,
that in the popular religion the severance of soul from body was
not desired, and the true self was not conceived as a thing apart
from body. At any rate the reason for desiring dissolution must
be sought from more popular sources.</p>

<p>I return therefore to a passage<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> on which I have already
touched more than once, the earliest passage of extant literature,
in which a dead man is represented as craving the dissolution of
his body. Why was it that the soul of Patroclus desired so
urgently the last rites for his body? Was it for the benefit of his
soul only? Popular religion, as we have seen, did not reckon
death a final severance of soul and body; for the soul might
return and re-animate the body. Was then dissolution believed
to complete the severance, annihilating the body and emancipating
the soul? Did the future happiness of the soul depend upon such
emancipation? Did Patroclus, in the case before us, crave dissolution
in order that his soul, finally severed from his body, might
find happiness?</p>

<p>Homer certainly peoples the lower world with souls only,
severed from their former bodies. It is clearly the soul only of
Patroclus which will pass the gates of Hades, when once his request
for the burial of his body has been fulfilled; for it is ‘the
souls, the semblances of the dead<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>,’ who bar his entrance thereto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[517]</span>
meanwhile. But those souls are not happy souls. The house of
Hades is not a place of happiness; it is dank, murky, mouldering;
and the souls themselves are not of a nature to enjoy anything;
they are feeble, impotent wraiths, mere semblances of men, all
doomed to the same miserable travesty of life; the bodies from
which they are now severed were their real selves<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>, and there remain
now only impalpable joyless phantoms. ‘Sooner,’ cries the spirit of
Achilles to Odysseus, ‘would I be a serf bound to the soil, in the
house of a portionless man whose living were but scant, than lord
over all the dead that are perished<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>’; for the old valour even of
Achilles avails him no more; his soul fares in the house of Hades
even as all others fare; all alike are doomed to everlasting futility
in a land of everlasting gloom. Fitly is the soul of Patroclus said
to have sped, at the moment of death, towards Hades’ realm
‘bewailing its fate in that it had left vigour and manhood<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>.’</p>

<p>How then comes it that anon the same soul is eager to pass the
gates of Hades? Surely the wanderings of the dead Patroclus,
whether in the form of a <i>revenant</i> as the popular belief would have
had it, or, according to Homer’s version, as a disembodied spirit,
would hardly be more pitiable than the lot which he in common
with all the dead must suffer below. Why then this eagerness?</p>

<p>I can find nothing in Homer to justify it; it appears to
me wholly inconsistent with the Homeric conception of the
under-world.</p>

<p>And this inconsistency is of wide bearing. The cases of
Patroclus and Elpenor are not isolated. The same eagerness for
dissolution on the part of the dead has, as we have seen, been
steadily recognised in all the relations between the living and the
dead from the days of Homer until now. That which is at
variance with the Homeric conception of the hereafter is not
merely the petition of Patroclus, but the idea on which the
funeral-customs of a whole people have been based for nearly
three thousand years.</p>

<p>Such a discrepancy cannot but force upon us the question how
far the Homeric conception of the hereafter was the popular
conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[518]</span></p>

<p>That the whole picture of the house of Hades and of the
condition of the departed therein was not an Homeric invention
is, I suppose, indisputable. Its two main features are the gloom
of the place and the lack of distinction between the lots of those
who dwell there<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>. Of these the first at any rate is frequent
enough in later literature, and indeed held so firm a place in the
Greek mind that ‘to see the light’ became synonymous with ‘to
live in this upper world’; and even down to the present day both
ideas live on. The constant epithets which Homer applies to the
house of Hades, ‘cold’ (<span class="greek">κρυερός</span>) and ‘mouldering’ (<span class="greek">εὐρώεις</span>), are
exactly reproduced in the epithets with which Hades, now a place
instead of a person, is described in modern dirges&mdash;<span class="greek">κρυοπαγωμένος</span>,
‘frozen,’ and <span class="greek">ἀραχνιασμένος</span>, ‘thick with spiders’ webs’<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a>;
and the same uniform misery of all the departed is likewise a
common theme in the many songs that deal with Charon and the
lower world. All this could not have been effected by the influence
of Homer alone, great though it was, if he had himself invented
the whole conception. It is clear that he utilised a conception
which was before his time, and still is, a popular conception.</p>

<p>But there is equally good evidence of a totally different presentation
of the future state. A fragment of one of Pindar’s dirges
contradicts the Homeric description of the lower world in every
point. ‘Upon the righteous the glorious sun sheddeth light
below while night is here, and amid meadows red with roses lieth
the space before their city’s gate, all hazy with frankincense and
laden with golden fruits; and some take their joy in horses and
feats of prowess, and others at the draught-board, and others in
the music of lutes, and among them every fair flower of happiness
doth blossom; and o’er that lovely land spreadeth the savour of
all manner of spices that be mingled with far-gleaming fire on
the gods’ altars<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a>.’ So then this under-world is not cold and murky,
but is warmed and lighted by the sun; its inhabitants are not
frail spirits incapable of joy, but take their pleasure as aforetime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[519]</span>
in the world above; nor is the lot of all the same, for it is only
the righteous who enjoy this bliss.</p>

<p>The popular character of this conception is equally clear.
The distinction between the varying fortunes of the dead&mdash;the
hope of happiness for some in contrast with the universal
misery of the Homeric under-world&mdash;is an idea which finds expression
throughout ancient literature; and if the house of Hades
often remains none the less a place of gloom, that is because the
abode of the righteous is often transferred to the islands of the
blest, and the dark under-world left as a place of punishment for
the wicked. At the present day too the same ideas are widely
current among the common-folk. It is true that the dirges more
generally pourtray the lower world as wrapped in Homeric gloom,
and the condition of the departed as monotonously miserable;
but the express purpose of these dirges, recited beside the dead
body before it is carried out to burial, is to excite the mourners to
a frenzy of grief, and the professional dirge-singer (for there are
still women in some parts of Greece who follow that calling) would
soon lose her work if, instead of harrowing the feelings of the
mourners, she took upon herself to comfort them; her whole
business is to move to tears those whom the bereavement itself
has left unmoved, or to stimulate to fresh outbursts of lamentation
those who are already spent with sorrow. But in a few folk-songs
is found the more cheerful belief that the departed still continue
the pursuits which they followed in this life<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>; while as for their
abode, any peasant who should have the Pindaric description
of the future home of the blessed explained to him, would unhesitatingly
identify it with that which he himself calls Paradise.
Some points perhaps in that description would surprise him no
less than they would please him, as for example the permission to
play draughts, but they would not obscure his recognition; the
place of fair flowers and fruits and scents could be none other
than Paradise. “The people of modern Greece,” says a Greek
writer<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>, ... “unable to comprehend the idea of spiritual joys,
consider Paradise a place of largely material and sensuous
pleasures. The Paradise of the Greek folk is watered by great
rivers, ... and in it there grow trees which diffuse odours sweet past
telling.... Agreeably with this reception of the idea of Paradise by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[520]</span>
the people, the fathers of the church also were compelled to
describe Paradise in terms of the senses as well as of the spirit,
thus making certain concessions to popular feeling and ideas.
‘Some,’ says John of Damascus<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>, ‘have imagined a sensuous
Paradise, others a spiritual Paradise. For my part I think that,
just as man himself has been created with senses as well as with
spirit, so the most holy close (<span class="greek">ἱερώτατον τέμενος</span>) to which he has
access appeals alike to the senses and to the spirit.’” The compromise
in this passage is cleverly justified, but it has not lasted;
the pagan part of it alone has survived, and the Paradise of the
modern folk is none other than that abode which Pindar described.
Even the rivers thereof, which are naturally desired above all
things by the inhabitants of a dry and dusty land, were probably
not absent from Pindar’s picture; for Plutarch, to whom we owe
the preservation of the fragment, passes in one passage from
actual quotation of the opening lines to a mention of smooth and
tranquil rivers flowing through the land<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>; and in the kindred
picture of the Islands of the Blest, which Pindar paints elsewhere,
he does not omit to mention the water wherewith the golden
flowers are refreshed<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>; for in his eyes too water was the best
of earth’s gifts, even as gold was the brightest of wrought
treasures<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>.</p>

<p>It was this high appreciation of water which first informed
a custom prevalent all over Greece on the occasion of funerals.
As the bier passes along the road, the friends and neighbours of the
dead man empty at their doorway or from their windows a vessel
of water, and usually throw down the vessel itself to be broken
on the stones of the road. This custom is evidently very old, for
in some places the use of the water, the very essence of the rite,
has become obsolete, and all that remains of the custom is the
breaking of a piece of crockery. And even though in most places
the custom is observed in full, its meaning has generally been
forgotten, and curious conjectures have been made to explain it.
Some interpret the custom as a symbol of that which has befallen
the dead man; the vessel is his body, the water is his soul; the
pouring out of the water symbolises the vanishing of the soul, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[521]</span>
the dead body will fall to pieces like the broken crock. Others
say that they pour out the water ‘in order to allay the burning
thirst of the dead man<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>,’ a notion ominously suggestive of the boon
which Dives sought of Lazarus. But the real purpose of the rite
is still known in some of the Cyclades, where exactly the same
custom is followed also on the occasion of a man’s departure from
his native village<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>, to live, as they say, in exile. And the purpose
is to promote the well-being of the dead or of the exile in the
new land to which he is going. The pouring out of the water is
in fact a rite of sympathetic magic designed to secure that the
unknown land shall also be well-watered and pleasant and plentiful;
and the breaking of the vessel which held the water is due,
I suppose, to a feeling that an instrument which has served
a magical purpose must not thereafter be put to profane and
mundane uses. This custom then in itself bears witness how
wide-spread is, or has been, the conception of the other world
as a land of delight wherein the pleasant things of this world shall
still abound.</p>

<p>Thus then it must be acknowledged that two contradictory
popular conceptions of the hereafter have survived side by
side as a twofold inheritance from the ancient world. The one
pervades the whole of Homer; the other is best expounded in
a fragment of Pindar<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>; and the fundamental difference between
them is this, that the one consigns all the dead alike to gloom and
misery, while the other distinguishes between the future fortunes
of the righteous and the unrighteous, and holds out the hope
of happiness in a yet brighter world than this. Whence came
these two conceptions?</p>

<p>The world which Homer describes is the Achaean world, and
I suspect that his under-world is likewise the Achaean under-world.
The Achaean religion, as exhibited in Homer, is in no way profound.
The gods are only Achaean princes on a yet grander scale, endowed
with immortality. Men’s relations with them are eminently
simple and practical; sacrifice is expected if prayers are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[522]</span>
answered. But both gods and men are concerned with this upper
world only; death closes all relations between them. The gods
are unconcerned, unless it be for some special favourite; they live
on Olympus as aforetime amid feasting, quarrelling, laughter, and
love; but men leave these pursuits and pastimes, and go down to
the misery of Hades’ house; their souls which fled lamenting from
their limbs at the hour of death still exist, else could they not
appear to living men in the visions of night; but their existence
is all misery, for they lack all that made this life pleasant. Their
joys had been the joys of a strenuous, full-blooded life, the joys of
battle, of feasting, of song, of comradeship; and these joys were no
more. The future existence of the soul was, to the Achaeans,
simply the negation of the present bodily life.</p>

<p>But the religion of a later age was by no means so simple.
The Homeric gods were still worshipped in the old way, and
received their sacrifices in exchange for favours desired or granted.
But there was another element in religion of which Homer shows
little trace&mdash;an element of awe and mystery. Homer indeed
names the Erinyes as beings concerned with the punishment of
certain sins; but he shows no knowledge of that awful doctrine of
blood-guilt which Aeschylus associates with them; the murdered
man’s power of vengeance is wholly ignored; for among the Achaeans
the next of kin might accept a price at the hands of the murderer,
and allow him to remain in the land<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>, without himself incurring
any pollution or any manifestation of his dead kinsman’s wrath.
Again Homer knows indeed of Demeter as a goddess connected
with the crops; but there is nothing in his casual mention of her
to suggest that the mysteries of her worship transcended the
rites of all the Olympian gods. Yet no one, I suppose, would
imagine that these profounder elements in ancient religion were
of post-Homeric growth or could possibly have been evolved from
the transparently simple religion of the Achaeans.</p>

<p>On the contrary it is known that the more mysterious rites
and doctrines of the Greek religion were a legacy from the
Pelasgians. That the mysteries of Demeter were Pelasgian in
origin is proved by the localities in which her worship most
flourished, and is corroborated by the explicit statement of
Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>, who was disposed to refer other mystic cults also to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[523]</span>
the same source<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a>. In fact the co-existence, or even the conflict, of
the old Pelasgian and the newer Achaean religions is constantly
recognised in ancient literature, and to the Pelasgian is ascribed
all that most touched men’s hearts, be it with awe or with pity&mdash;with
awe as in the conflict between the Erinyes and the new
dynasty of gods whom Apollo and Athene represent, with pity in
the dolorous struggle of Prometheus against the tyrant Zeus. The
Pelasgian religion, with all its horrors, drew the real sympathies
of the mystic Aeschylus; he could worship in deepest reverence
Demeter and her mysteries<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>; he could worship perhaps even the
‘reverend goddesses,’ horrible though they were in their displeasure;
but his heart must have been cold towards the
usurping Olympian gods. There is true insight in that passage
of Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> where Aeschylus summarises the benefits conferred
by great poets on the Greek race, and praises Homer, the
Achaean poet, for his lessons in discipline and valour and warfare,
but Orpheus, sometimes reputed the founder of the Pelasgian
mysteries, for instituting religious rites and teaching men to
abstain from bloodshed. And the feelings of Aeschylus were the
feelings of his countrymen. The Athenians boasted of a great
Achaean goddess as the foundress and patroness of their city, but
their personal hopes of future happiness centred in the Pelasgian
Demeter. The same generation of Athenians listened with delight
to Aristophanes’ ridicule of those gods whom Homer accounted
greatest, and were aghast at the thought that the mysteries had
been profaned. The Achaean gods, it would seem, made good
figure-heads for the official religion of the state; they served as
majestic patrons of a city, or of a great national festival where
religion was of less real account than horse-racing, athletics, and
commerce; but the hearts of the people clave to the older, more
awful, more mysterious deities of the Pelasgians, and the holiest
sanctuaries<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> were those which had been holy long before the
intrusion of the Achaean gods.</p>

<p>It was to this Pelasgian element in Hellenic religion that the
doctrine of future rewards and punishments belonged; for, as
we shall see more fully in the next chapter, participation in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[524]</span>
Pelasgian mysteries of Demeter at Eleusis was held to be an
earnest of future bliss, from which the impure or uninitiated were
excluded.</p>

<p>Thus then there were two popular conceptions of the future
life&mdash;the Achaean conception of universal misery in a cold and
gloomy under-world, and the Pelasgian conception which distinguished
between the lots of the righteous and the unrighteous,
and held out to some men the promise of bliss. Now with the
former conception, as we have already seen, the belief that the
dead eagerly desired dissolution is utterly inconsistent; none could
be in haste to pass the gates of Hades with the prospect of nothing
but misery within. But where there were hopes of happiness, the
eagerness for dissolution as a means of attaining thereto is at once
intelligible. This desire then, which has constantly pervaded the
mind of the Greek people and has furnished the single motive of
their funeral-rites down to the present day, is of Pelasgian origin;
and if Homer borrowed it and incongruously combined it with a
purely Achaean presentation of the under-world, we must no more
judge of its real meaning by the Homeric setting of it than we
would form an opinion of the place of the Erinyes or of Demeter
in Greek religion by Homer’s occasional references to them.</p>

<p>The fact then that Homer, in accordance with the Achaean
religion, considered the dissolution of the body to mean the annihilation
of the body and represented the soul as alone entering
into the lower world is wholly immaterial to the present enquiry.
It is the Pelasgian conception of future bliss with which we are
concerned; for that alone can account for the eagerness of the
dead to obtain dissolution. What then are the blissful occupations
of the righteous in the other world? ‘Some,’ says Pindar, ‘take
their joy in horses and feats of prowess, and others at the draught-board,
and others in the music of lutes.’ Clearly these dead are
very different beings from the souls which peopled the Homeric
under-world. Athletics could be no pastime for feeble unsubstantial
spirits; the game of draughts would be ill suited to
them that have no mind in them<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a>; and those whose thin utterance
is like the squeak<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> of a bat would get and give little pleasure
by singing to the lute. No; the pursuits of the dead as depicted
by Pindar are the pursuits which men of flesh and blood enjoy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[525]</span>
and the abode in which they dwell, the paradise of flowers and
fruits and sweet odours, is an abode to gladden men of flesh and
blood. But a people whose ideal of future bliss lay in bodily
enjoyments cannot surely have looked forward to the annihilation
of the body and the survival of the soul alone; the joys which
they anticipated hereafter presupposed the continuance of some
kind of bodily existence.</p>

<p>Such a notion moreover cannot but seem more in harmony
with the whole spirit of the Greek world than the Homeric
doctrine of the survival of the soul only. A nation so conspicuous
for their love of human beauty and their delight in the human
form could not have viewed the extinction thereof with any feeling
other than the most poignant regret&mdash;a feeling which, as we
know, the Homeric doctrine did actually inspire in those who
accepted it. The more thoughtful and hopeful religion of the
Pelasgians, unless it had anticipated the philosophy of Plato in
decrying the body and exalting the soul&mdash;an idea of which there
is no trace&mdash;was bound to give promise that body as well as soul
should survive death and dissolution.</p>

<p>Again it may fairly be claimed that in any religion of a profounder
character than the Achaean, in any religion which contains
some positive ideas of the future life and does not view it merely
as the negation of the present life, that which men hope to become
in the future state is something more similar to the deity or deities
in whom they believe. Their conception of godhead and their
conception of their own condition after death are of necessity
founded upon the same ideal of happiness&mdash;a happiness which the
gods already enjoy and which men hope to share. The Buddhist
looks forward to the day when he shall become like his deity&mdash;even
one with his deity&mdash;clean from the grossness of matter, free
from bodily desires and necessities, spirit unalloyed. The Christian
believes in a God who became man and survived the death of man
not in the form of a spirit only but with flesh and bones, and he
himself looks forward to the resurrection of the body. Socrates
held that wisdom and goodness were one and pertained to the soul
only, and the God into whose presence his soul would pass after
death was ‘the good and wise God,’ rightly called Hades, that is,
the invisible and spiritual, with whom the soul has kinship<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[526]</span>
what of the ordinary Greek? His gods were not invisible or
spiritual. Pelasgian and Achaean deities alike were beings of
flesh and blood, robust, active, sensuous; they ate and drank, they
waked and slept, they married, they begot or bore children. Such
was the Greek’s conception of godhead, such his ideal of blessedness.
How then should he look forward to the annihilation of the body
with any feeling but dismay? How could his hopes of future bliss
not involve of necessity a belief in the survival of both body and
soul?</p>

<p>I suggest then that the dissolution of the body, which the
dead so eagerly desired, far from being regarded as a final and
complete severance of soul and body, was in the Pelasgian religion
the means of their re-union in another world. Death was only
a temporary severance of the two entities which together form
a living man capable of enjoying physical pleasures. The soul at
the moment of death went down to the nether world in advance,
or, it may be, as is sometimes held by the peasants of modern
Greece<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>, hovered about the body until its dissolution was complete.
But the dead body certainly remained in this world, at the place
where it lay evident to men’s eyes; it could not pass to the other
world at once; it could not ever pass thither without the assistance
of friends still living; it was too gross and too impotent, bereft of
the soul, to make its own way to the home of the dead. Therefore
upon the survivors was imposed the sacred charge of resolving it
into elements more refined, and of enabling it thus to pass out of
human touch and sight to a home which the soul could reach unaided.
When this process was effected by inhumation, the period of forty
days required for complete dissolution was the critical period in the
dead man’s existence; if the body was ‘bound’ and indissoluble
for any cause and the soul re-entered it before the proper time,
the <i>revenant</i> was a pitiable wanderer, sharing in the joys neither
of this world nor of the next; the mourners therefore took such
measures as they could to prevent that calamity, by entertaining
the acquaintances of the dead man and prevailing upon them to
revoke any curses wherewith he was bound, and by laying in
the dead man’s mouth a charm which should bar the soul’s
re-entry. When cremation was employed, the dissolution of the
body was more speedy and more sure; and it is not therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[527]</span>
difficult to understand that the Pelasgians, conscious though they
must have been that in religion they were as far in advance of the
Achaeans as in material civilisation they were behind, should have
early adopted the use of fire in the interests of the dead. But no
matter which rite was employed, the ultimate effect was the same;
the heavy, helpless corpse that had been laid upon the pyre or in
the grave vanished, and nought but the bones remained. Whither
then had it vanished? How had the visible become invisible?
Surely by passing from this visible world to the world invisible.
There is nothing to suggest that this disappearance meant to the
Greeks annihilation; that word indeed had no counterpart in their
speech; the strongest term of the Greek language by which one
might attempt, and would still fail, to render the word ‘annihilate,’
would be <span class="greek">ἀφανίζειν</span> or <span class="greek">ἀιστοῦν</span>, ‘to make unseen.’ And on the
other hand their conception of future happiness in another world
is positive evidence that they believed dissolution to mean not
annihilation, but the vanishing of the body to be re-united with
the soul in the unseen world.</p>

<p>I am of course far from suggesting that these views which I
have sketched formed a definite religious doctrine to which every
Greek would have subscribed. No people have evinced greater
liberty of thought on religious matters; no people have been less
hampered by hierarchical limitations and the claims of authority;
nowhere have wider divergences of religious opinion been tolerated;
nowhere else have the advocates of material philosophies and of
spiritual philosophies been brought into sharper contrast and yet
held in equal repute. But it is not with the vagaries of individuals
and the new departures of great thinkers that I am concerned;
my purpose is simply to trace the general trend of thought as
regards the relation of body and soul after death among the mass
of the Greek people.</p>

<p>And in so doing I fully realise the danger of over-statement.
Probably the mass of mankind in religious matters perform many
acts without full consciousness of their motive; they instinctively
follow tradition without enquiring into the meaning and
the mutual relation of the customs with which they comply;
and if ever they try to justify to their reason the acts to which
instinct prompts them, they may be at a loss to form a consistent
theory out of the several motives which they would assign to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[528]</span>
several acts. If therefore I try not only to disengage from among
the network of religious and philosophical speculation a thread of
simple popular belief, but also to present that thread unknotted
and continuous, I may be attempting that which the mass of the
Greek people seldom and with difficulty performed for themselves.
To enunciate as a doctrine that which may have been a subconscious
or only partially realised belief&mdash;to present as a consistent
theory ideas which, separately apprehended, formed the
acknowledged motives of separate acts, but whose mutual relations
were seldom investigated&mdash;to formulate in words that which may
have been no more than a vague aspiration of men’s hearts&mdash;this
is necessarily to over-state. There lies the danger. But for my
part, while admitting that in all probability there was among the
Greek people of old, as among the Greek people and others too
to-day, a large amount of unintelligent religion, I claim that some
such conception as I have outlined of the relation between soul
and body and of their future existence is the only possible explanation
of the manifold customs and beliefs relating to death
and dissolution which have been discussed, and fairly represents
the general trend of thought among the inheritors of the Pelasgian
religion.</p>

<p>This conclusion is not a little strengthened by the evidence of
a custom common to both ancient and modern Greece, which
presupposes the continuance of physical desires and needs after
death. To make a present of food indicates a belief on the part
of the donor that the recipient can eat; to make a present of
clothing implies a belief that the recipient has a body to be
covered; and it is these two things, food and clothing, the
elementary requisites of living men, which have most constantly
been brought, either at the time of the funeral or later, as gifts
to the dead. Other gifts there were also in different ages;
treasures of wrought gold for the princes of Mycenae; articles
of the toilet for Athenian ladies whose first care even beyond the
grave would be their complexion; toys for the children. But
while each grave that is opened may tell its own story, humorous
or pathetic, of those tastes and pursuits of the occupant for which
the same provision was made in the next world as in this, it is in
the supply of the common necessaries of all mankind that the
popular Greek notions concerning the dead are most clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[529]</span>
revealed; for the custom has continued without intermission or
sensible alteration down to this day.</p>

<p>In the Mycenaean age the dead were supplied with a store of
food at the time of the funeral, but there is no evidence to show
whether the gifts were renewed subsequently<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>. I incline to
suppose that they were; for the belief of later ages in some sort
of bodily existence after death has already been traced back to
the Pelasgians; and the custom of later ages therefore of continuing
to supply the dead with bodily necessaries was probably
derived from the same source. But in any case the Mycenaean
custom of providing food for the dead at the time of the funeral
is sufficient proof that the dead were thought to have bodily needs,
and therefore also bodily existence.</p>

<p>The Achaeans of the Homeric age seldom presented the dead
man with gifts of food at the funeral, and never apparently afterwards.
The only gift, if such it can be called, which was commonly
burned along with the dead body was the warrior’s own armour;
but it is so natural, quite apart from any religious motive, for a
soldier’s body to be laid out arrayed in its wonted accoutrements
and to have, as it were, a military funeral, that little importance
can attach to it. Other gifts were rare. The funeral of Patroclus
is quite exceptional, and, like the return of Patroclus’ soul with
its urgent petition for burial, seems wholly inconsistent with the
Homeric presentment of after-death existence. The soul being
doomed to a shadowy impotent semblance of life could have no
part in physical needs or pleasures<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>. Nor does Homer enlighten
us as to the purpose of the abundant gifts, which included not
only food but slaughtered dogs and horses<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>; he speaks only of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[530]</span>
providing ‘all that it beseemeth that a man should have when he
goeth beneath the murky gloom<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a>.’ Indeed I question whether
Homer had any clear conception of their utility; they seem rather
to have been vaguely honorific; and since the custom of making
such gifts is neither usual in Homer nor in harmony with his idea
of future existence, I hold it likely that once again he was drawing
upon the Pelasgian religion in order to give to the last rites of
Patroclus the maximum of splendour.</p>

<p>The Dipylon-period puts an end to all uncertainty; thenceforward
down to the present day the Greek custom of providing
the dead with the necessaries of bodily life will be found to have
been uniform and continuous. There has been no interruption of
the simple practice of providing the dead with food both at the
time of the funeral and at stated intervals thereafter. For the
Dipylon-period this has been proved by the contents of the graves
and by the strata of burnt soil observed at Eleusis<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> above them.
The same phenomena continue to present themselves also in
the case of later graves at Athens, certainly down to the third
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and, though any detailed description of graves of a
still later date is hard to find, the custom unquestionably still
prevailed; for literary evidence, overlapping that of archaeology
at the start, carries on our knowledge of the custom into the
Christian era.</p>

<p>The <i>Choephori</i> of Aeschylus takes its very name from the practice
of pouring wine or other beverages on the graves of the dead for
them to consume; and the word <span class="greek">χοαί</span> was specially applied to this
kind of libation as opposed to the <span class="greek">λοιβαί</span> or <span class="greek">σπονδαί</span> wherewith
gods were propitiated. Similarly the Greek language possessed a
special word for gifts of food (or other perishable gifts such as
flowers) brought to the graves of the dead; these were called
<span class="greek">ἐναγίσματα</span> in strict contrast with the sacrifices (<span class="greek">θυσίαι</span>, etc.) by
which gods were appeased<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>. These presents of food were regularly
made on two occasions at least after the funeral; there were the
<span class="greek">τρίτα</span> brought, according to modern computation, on the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[531]</span>
day, and the <span class="greek">ἔνατα</span> on the eighth day: how regular was the
custom of bringing them may be judged from the passing
references of Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>, Isaeus<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a>, and Aeschines<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>. In addition
to these two meals there were others either on the thirtieth day
after the funeral or on the thirtieth of each month&mdash;for the interpretation
to be put on the term <span class="greek">τριακάδες</span><a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> seems doubtful&mdash;also
<span class="greek">γενέσια</span><a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>, apparently a birthday-feast given to the dead, and
<span class="greek">νεκύσια</span><a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> to commemorate the anniversary of the death. The
exact details of date however are of minor importance; the
significant fact is this, that at certain intervals after the well-known
<span class="greek">περίδειπνον</span> or funeral-feast, held on the day of burial,
other meals were served to the dead; and the Greek words
themselves corroborate the view that ‘meals,’ not ‘sacrifices,’ is
the right term to use; for as the funeral-feast is <span class="greek">περίδειπνον</span>,
so also the <span class="greek">νεκύσια</span> are called by Artemidorus<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> not <span class="greek">ἱερὰ</span> but
<span class="greek">δεῖπνα</span>. These meals, being burnt over the place where the dead
body lay, or being deposited unburnt in some large vase set up
at the head of the grave, were thereby devoted to the use of the
dead and became <span class="greek">ἐναγίσματα</span> in that curious half-way sense
between ‘sacred’ and ‘accursed’ for which our language has no
equivalent save the imported word ‘taboo’&mdash;objects devoted to a
sacred purpose and bringing the curse of desecration on anyone
who should pervert them to another use. The Greek language
then was careful to mark the difference between gifts presented
to the dead and propitiatory offerings made to the gods; and the
difference was observed, not because the presents differed in kind,
but because the conceptions of their purposes were different. The
gods demanded sacrifices under pain of their displeasure; the dead
needed food as living men need it, and their friends supplied it,
not in fear, but in love.</p>

<p>These old pagan customs were at first discountenanced by the
Church<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a>. But the common people clung to them with great
tenacity<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a>, and after a while they appear to have received even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[532]</span>
official encouragement; for St Anastasius Sinaites, bishop of
Antioch during the latter half of the sixth century, enjoined
the observance of them, and in so doing used some of the old
names by which the customs were known in pre-Christian times.
‘Perform,’ he wrote, ‘the offices of the third day (<span class="greek">τρίτα</span>) for them
that sleep, with psalms and hymns, because of him who rose from
sleep on the third day, and the offices of the ninth day (<span class="greek">ἔνατα</span>) to
remind those that yet live of them that have fallen asleep, and
the offices of the fortieth day according to the old law and form
(for even so did the people mourn for Moses), and the offices of the
anniversary in memory of the dead, with gifts from his substance
to the poor as a remembrance of him<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a>.’ In this passage the cloak
of Christian decency which St Anastasius provided does not
entirely cover the nakedness of heathen superstition. There is
indeed much aetiological skill in the saint’s manipulation of
Biblical references; but the <span class="greek">τρίτα</span> and <span class="greek">ἔνατα</span> practised in his
day, despite the addition of Christian prayers and hymns, were
without doubt the same in essence as those to which Aristophanes
and others allude&mdash;meals provided for the dead; for such indeed
they still remain.</p>

<p>At the present day the funeral service usually concludes with
a distribution of baked-meats and wine to the company assembled
at the grave-side, and a share of both is given to the dead. In
some districts this function means more than the serving of light
refreshments, and the grave-side becomes the scene of a substantial
meal, from which however meat is excluded; for, owing
to Christian ideas of fasting, it is generally held to be ‘spiritual’
for the mourners to abstain from meat for the period of forty days.
It is to this meal at the graveside that the word <span class="greek">μακαρία</span> seems to
be properly applied, in the sense of a ‘feast of blessing,’ and it
obviously corresponds with the term <span class="greek">μακαρίτης</span>, ‘blessed,’ which
was in antiquity, and still remains, the Greek equivalent of our
‘deceased’ or ‘late.’</p>

<p>Subsequently, in the evening after the funeral or even on two
or three evenings thereafter, the nearer friends and relatives of
the dead assemble for another funeral-feast. This meal, which in
ancient times was called the <span class="greek">περίδειπνον</span> is now commonly known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[533]</span>
as the <span class="greek">παρηγορία</span><a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> or ‘comforting.’ It is held in the house of the
nearest relative<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>, as was done in the time of Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>, and
its modern name seems to indicate that the ‘consolation’ of the
bereaved is its chief purpose; and certainly some temporary
solace is on many such occasions poured into the mourners’
breasts; for the Greek peasants, always abstemious save on
certain great festivals such as Easter and these funeral-parties,
make no scruple of drinking and pressing their host to drink
until a riotous cheerfulness prevails. But though the feast is
designed to assuage the grief of the living, the dead are not
forgotten; for a special portion of food is often sent to the grave
from the house of mourning before the guests of the evening
arrive. Thus, though the dead is not felt to have any part in
the actual ‘feast of comforting’&mdash;for this feast is really provided by
the guests, who bring their own contributions of food and wine,
while the host provides only the accommodation for the company<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a>&mdash;yet
the physical needs of the departed are satisfied on this first
day beneath the earth in the same measure as when he was above
ground. Two meals are provided, one immediately after the
funeral, the other in the evening.</p>

<p>Nor is the nature of this food lacking in interest. Locally
indeed many varieties may be found, the gifts including such
ordinary comestibles as bread, cheese, olives, caviare of the baser
sort, <i>piláf</i> (the well-known Turkish dish of which the main ingredients
are rice and oil), and probably indeed anything, save
meat, which the peasant’s larder can supply; but the most
generally approved viand is a specially baked flat cake spread
with honey. Now it will be remembered that jars of honey were
among the gifts of food on the pyre of Patroclus<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>, but a more
striking coincidence is to be found in Aristophanes’ mention of a
<span class="greek">μελιτοῦττα</span> or honey-cake in connexion with a funeral. ‘What,’
says Lysistrata mockingly to the old deputy (<span class="greek">πρόβουλος</span>), ‘what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[534]</span>
do you mean by not dying? You shall have room to lie; you can
buy a coffin; and I myself will knead you a honey-cake at once<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>.’
From this passage it would appear that not only has the custom
of providing food for the dead remained in force from very early
days, but even the kind of food has not changed in more than two
thousand years. The honey-cake, though no longer known as
<span class="greek">μελιτοῦττα</span>, in reference to its chief attraction, but <span class="greek">ψυχόπηττα</span><a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>,
‘soul-cake,’ in reference to the occasion of its making, is still
apparently prepared according to a classical recipe, and sweetness
still gratifies the palate of the dead.</p>

<p>The dates subsequent to the funeral at which food is provided
for the dead have already<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> been mentioned. Where the custom
is most fully observed, these are the third, sixth, ninth, and fortieth
days, the last days of the third, sixth, and ninth months, and three
anniversaries, the last of the three being also usually the day for
the exhumation of the bones. But in many villages the custom is
less extended, and it is held sufficient to observe in this way the
third, ninth, and fortieth days<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> and the first anniversary. This
minimum of modern practice, it will be observed, is the exact tale
of days recommended for observance by St Anastasius, and without
doubt the sanction of the Church has helped to preserve the
custom.</p>

<p>The Church likewise is wholly responsible for the name by
which these days are known, <span class="greek">μνημόσυνα</span> or ‘memorial-feasts’; and
it would be wrong to infer therefrom that the peasants attach no
meaning to these rites save that which the name ‘memorial-feast’
suggests. Rather it would seem that the Church in permitting the
continuance of a pagan custom tried to diminish its significance.
The words of St Anastasius make it clear that such was his
attitude. He bids that the anniversary be observed ‘in memory
of the dead, with gifts from his substance to the poor as a
remembrance of him’; and the repetition contained in the phrase
shows in what aspect he wished the custom to be viewed. But as
a matter of fact the real purpose of the custom was not to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[535]</span>
green the memory of the dead by charitable distributions of his
goods, but partly, as we have seen, to induce those persons who
were invited to the feast to forgive the dead man and to revoke
any curses with which they had bound him, and partly to minister
to the dead man’s own bodily needs; and in spite of ecclesiastical
influence to the contrary, this twofold purpose is still generally
recognised, and that portion of the food which is not consumed by
the company invited or by the priests, but is actually left on the
grave, is honestly intended as nourishment for the dead body there
interred.</p>

<p>This motive was fully appreciated by a French traveller of the
seventeenth century; describing these grave-side feasts, he says,
‘Frequent presents of cakes, wine, rice, fruits, and other eatables,
decked out with flowers and ribbons, are taken to the tomb.’
There, he continues, the priest blesses the food and takes a good
share of it, and a feast is then held ‘wherein they seek to make the
dead man participate as well<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>.’ Thus even now, after centuries of
Christianity, there seems to be no change of feeling among the
common-folk, and their intention, or one part of it, is still best
summed up in the phrase of Euripides, ‘to render sustenance unto
the dead<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a>.’</p>

<p>The food proper to these meals subsequent to the day of
the funeral is known as <span class="greek">κόλλυβα</span>. It consists of grain, usually
wheat, boiled whole, and thus closely resembles the English
‘frumenty.’ It is sometimes garnished and made more palatable
by the addition of sugar ornaments, almonds, raisins, and pieces
of pomegranate, but the essential thing is boiled grain<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a>. How the
word <span class="greek">κόλλυβα</span> obtained this meaning is not known to me<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>; but
the food itself is quite probably a legacy from the ancient world.
The <i>silicernium</i> or funeral-feast of the Romans took its name
apparently from <i>siliquae</i>, some kind of pulse, which must therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[536]</span>
be supposed to have formed the chief dish; and beans are at the
present day an important part of the funeral-meats in Sardinia<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a>.
It is not unlikely therefore that the use of boiled beans or grain
in the service of the dead is an old custom common to the coasts
of the Mediterranean. The honey-cake on the day of the funeral
is of ancient prescription; the boiled wheat on later occasions may
equally well be so. At any rate the principle of supplying the
dead with meals both at the funeral and on certain fixed days
thereafter remains absolutely unchanged, and the custom is still
understood to be a means of ministering to the bodily needs of
the dead.</p>

<p>And as with the gifts of food, the ancient <span class="greek">ἐναγίσματα</span>, so also
with the gifts of drink, the ancient <span class="greek">χοαί</span>. It is on record that
among the Greeks of Macedonia, Cappadocia, and other outlying
districts<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>, the custom of pouring out red wine on the graves of the
dead at the so-called memorial-feasts is still sedulously observed;
and though I have nowhere witnessed the practice, I have been
told on good authority that in Aegina also and in some parts of
Crete it is in vogue. For the use of water I can myself answer;
and it is not a little interesting to observe that while the dates
on which food is set before the dead man have been somewhat
conventionally limited in number, water, the prime necessary of
life, is often taken to the grave daily<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> up to the fortieth day.</p>

<p>Again, in the matter of providing clothing for the dead, ancient
practice is well known. A store of raiment was buried with the
dead, and so great a store that it was necessary for Solon to
impose a legal limit by which three outer garments (<span class="greek">ἱμάτια</span>) were
named as the maximum<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a>. But this restriction applied only to
the actual funeral, and did not prohibit renewed gifts of clothing
at subsequent dates. To judge from a passage of Thucydides,
this was an annual duty. The Plataeans, in their appeal to the
Lacedaemonians for protection, are made to plead their performance
of this kindness as a claim upon Spartan gratitude.
‘Turn your eyes,’ they say, ‘to the tombs of your fathers, who
fell in the Persian wars and were buried in our land. Year by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[537]</span>
year we were wont to do them honour at the public charge with
gifts of clothing and all else that is customary<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>.’</p>

<p>Some vestiges of this custom remain to the present day. The
dead are commonly dressed in their best clothes for the lying-in-state
and for the procession to the grave, during which, it must
be remembered, the body is always carried on an open bier, exposed
to view. Often too these clothes are buried with the dead;
but sometimes when, as among the poorer peasant-women, the
richly-embroidered festival dress is too costly a thing thus to
abandon, and is handed down as an heirloom from mother to
daughter, the body is stripped at the grave-side of its fine
array; and indeed so far, I am told, has the custom degenerated
in Athens and some of the other towns, that costumes of special
magnificence may be hired from the undertakers and sent back
from the churchyard to them. In such cases the old meaning of
the custom is lost, and a vulgar desire for pomp and parade has
taken its place. But among the simpler folk of the country this
is not the case; for, apart from the custom of burying the dead in
their best clothes, there is in the folk-songs mention of gifts of
clothing and other necessaries of life sent by the hand of one
recently dead to those who have gone before<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>.</p>

<p>It appears then that the ancient custom of providing for the
bodily wants of the departed is still alive, still significant; and
surely it is incredible that a people who for more than two
thousand years have continued to resort to the graves in which
the dead bodies of their friends are laid, and there to set out meat
and drink and clothing and other things suited to their erstwhile
needs and pursuits, could all along have believed that these gifts
were vanity, that the food could not strengthen, the wine could
not cheer, the clothing could not warm the departed, but that
they lay henceforth cold, tasteless, insentient. For if men had so
believed, then a custom, not merely lacking the alliance of religious
belief, but standing in perpetual antagonism to it, could not have
held its ground, as this custom has done, century after century
with vigour unabated. Rather the continuity of the custom might
alone prove, even if other considerations had not guided us to the
same conclusion, that the departed were held to possess a nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[538]</span>
no less corporeal, an existence no less material, than that which
belonged both to living men and to the gods whom they hoped to
resemble even more closely hereafter. The same food as men ate
was offered to the gods in sacrifice that they too might eat; why
bring it to the dead, if they had no power to eat? The wine that
men drank was poured out for the gods in libation, that they too
might drink; why waste it upon the soil of the grave, if the dead
had no power to drink? A robe such as Athenian women wore
was presented to Athene year by year, that she might wear it;
why furnish the dead with gifts of raiment, if it must rot unworn?
It is impossible to evade the conclusion that the same bodily needs
and propensities were ascribed by the Greek folk to the departed
as to living men and to deathless gods.</p>

<p>Thus then the people of Greece are shown to have pursued
constantly two aims in their treatment of the dead&mdash;to ensure the
dissolution of the body, and also to provide the body with the
necessaries of existence. Unless therefore anyone is prepared to
suppose that the Greek people have been constantly actuated by
two conflicting motives, the desire to annihilate and the desire to
keep alive, dissolution cannot have meant to them annihilation,
but rather a modification of the conditions of bodily existence;
and that modification can only have meant that the existence of
the body in this world indeed ended&mdash;for the substance laid in the
grave vanished&mdash;but continued in another world. But if bodily
existence continued in that other world whither the soul too sped,
the body and the soul having reached the same place would surely
not be imagined to remain separate, but to be re-united. The
eagerness for dissolution meant therefore eagerness for the re-union
of body and soul.</p>

<p>And there is a good means of testing the popular belief even
as regards this last step. If the body and soul were really believed
to be re-united as soon as dissolution was complete, the dead man
in the lower world would assuredly be as well able to take care
of himself as he had been while dwelling in this world, and the
obligation of his relatives to provide him with food would cease,
although of course they might, voluntarily and without any compulsion
of duty, continue their gifts<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a>. But it would be at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[539]</span>
rate permissible, on this theory, to discontinue all care for the
dead when once his body was no longer helpless but restored to
its activity by re-union with the soul; and it is to be expected
that the Greek people should sometimes avail themselves of the
exemption from the task of feeding and otherwise tending the
dead. Such action would be the natural outcome of the belief that
dissolution meant the re-union of body and soul; and if I can show
that such action has been or is commonly taken, the existence of
the belief will have borne the best test, the demonstration of a
custom arising from it.</p>

<p>The period required for dissolution, according to common belief,
is either forty days or three years&mdash;the former being the really
popular period, while the latter was fixed indeed by the Church
but in many districts has been popularly accepted. Hence, if my
views are correct, the meals provided for the dead and all other
marks of care ought to cease sometimes at the fortieth day and
sometimes at the third anniversary.</p>

<p>As regards the present time, I do not know of any place,
though it would not surprise me to hear of one, in which the
so-called memorial feasts are discontinued after the fortieth day;
but I have already cited evidence to show that the memorial-feasts
of later date are definitely ecclesiastical in origin, and even retain
to this day in one district a distinctly ecclesiastical tone<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a>. Therefore
before a necessitous priesthood had succeeded in extending the
custom, the ministration to the bodily wants of the dead clearly
did cease when dissolution was popularly supposed to be complete.
This conclusion is fortified by a most striking piece of evidence. The
priests’ interest has naturally been limited to the food and wine
supplied to the dead; for a supply of water they have not been dependent
upon the perquisites of their office. Hence it comes that
the water, which, as I noted above, is often supplied to the dead
day by day, without any accompanying provision of food, ceases
to be brought after the fortieth day. The wants of the dead man
have been assiduously satisfied until, in popular reckoning, his
dissolution is complete, and ecclesiastical influence has had no
motive for encouraging a longer continuance of the custom so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[540]</span>
as water is concerned. The fortieth day then was without doubt
the old popular limit of the time during which the supply of all
kinds of provision was obligatory.</p>

<p>Nowadays, on the contrary, the presents of food to the dead
are generally continued up to the third anniversary, when exhumation
takes place. Then, if the evidence of men’s eyes assures
them that dissolution has been duly effected&mdash;that the body is
gone and only the white bones remain&mdash;there is no further thought
or provision for the dead; but in the rare cases in which the disintegration
of the corpse is not yet complete, the relatives are not
freed from their obligations. I witnessed a remarkable case of
this kind at Leonídi on the east coast of Laconia. Two graves
had just been opened when I arrived, and the utmost anxiety prevailed
because in both cases there was only partial decomposition&mdash;in
one case so little that the general outline of the features
could be made out&mdash;and it was feared that one or both of the
dead persons had become <i>vrykolakes</i>. The remains, when I saw
them, had been removed to the chapel attached to the burial-ground.
Meanwhile the question was debated as to what should be
done with them. Dissolution must be effected both in the interests
of the dead themselves and in those of the whole community.
Extraordinary measures were required. The best measure&mdash;I am
reporting what I actually heard&mdash;the best measure next to prayer
(which had been tried without effect) was to burn the remains,
and the bolder spirits of the village counselled this plan; but this
would have been a breach of law and order, and the authorities of
the place would have none of it. The priest proposed re-interment;
but here the relatives objected. They had had trouble enough and
expense enough; they had kept ‘the unsleeping lamp’ burning at
the grave, and had provided all the memorial feasts; they would
not consent to re-inter the body and to be at the same charge for
an indefinite time, without knowing when the corpse might be
properly ‘loosed’ and their tendance of it over. They would find
some way of dissolving it, and that speedily.</p>

<p>And so indeed they did; and I, for a short time, was a spectator
of the scene. On the floor of the chapel there were two large
baskets containing the remains; there were men seated beside
them busy with knives; and there were women kneeling at
wash-tubs and scouring the bones that were handed to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[541]</span>
with soap and soda. The work continued for two days. At the
end of that time the bones were shown white and clean. All else
had disappeared&mdash;had probably been burnt in secret, but the
secret was kept close. It was therefore claimed and allowed
that dissolution was complete.</p>

<p>The attitude adopted by the relatives on this occasion makes
it perfectly clear that all the care expended on the dead is
obligatory up to the time of dissolution, but no longer. So long
as the fleshly substance remains in this world, provision of food
must be made for it; when it has disappeared and only the bones
are left, the departed cease to be dependent upon their surviving
relatives, and no further anxiety is felt for their welfare.</p>

<p>Nor must it be supposed that the cleaning and whitening
of the bones in the case which I have described had anything to do
with a desire to preserve the bones as relics of the dead. Such a
custom is indeed well known in Greek monasteries; at Megaspélaeon,
for instance, the wealthiest and most famous monastery
of Greece proper, there is an ossuary in which the monks take
great pride. On one side, ranged against the wall, stands a large
triangular heap of skulls; the opposite wall is decorated with
cleverly-designed geometrical figures carried out in other bones;
while in a corner perhaps may be seen a basket or two full
of material awaiting the decorator’s convenience. My guide,
I remember, pointed out to me the skulls of many of the
distinguished monks of past time, and indicated with great
satisfaction the spot which he had bespoken for his own.
But the usage of monastic bodies has in truth little bearing
upon the popular semi-pagan beliefs and customs; the practice
of storing up the bones of members of a religious order in an
ossuary is more closely akin to the old custom of preserving relics
of saints and martyrs; it is to the usage of the common-folk in
such matters that we must look. And what do they do with the
white or whitened bones? They throw them away and expend
no more care upon them. At Leonídi itself, close beside the
fenced-in burial-ground, but unprotected from the intrusion of
man or beast, there is a square open pit into which the bones
of many generations have been tipped like rubbish, lying at random
in confusion as they fell. Nor is this a solitary case. In far-away
Sciathos I recall the same scene as at Leonídi&mdash;a chapel set on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[542]</span>
wooded hill, the churchyard about it neatly kept and the graves
of the recently buried well-tended, but just beyond its precincts
a rough hole in the ground open to sun and rain, and ‘some two
fathoms of bones,’ as a peasant said jestingly, lying in neglect and
disarray. These pits, which are to be seen throughout Greece,
are indeed dignified by the Church with the name of cemeteries
(<span class="greek">κοιμητήρια</span><a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>); but they command no respect on the part of
the peasant. He will cross himself as he passes chapel or
enters churchyard, but he will jest over the depository of outcast
bones. In a word, when it is seen that every trace of the dead
body save only the white bones has disappeared, the common-folk
exchange their extraordinary devotion to the duties of tending
the dead for a total unconcern. And the reason for this can only
be that the dead body no longer lies helpless and dependent for
its existence upon the sustenance which they from time to time
provide, but has vanished to a land where, re-united with the soul,
it regains its activity and independence.</p>

<p>Such, I believe, is the trend of religious thought which, almost
insensibly, has guided the actions of the Greek people from the
Pelasgian age until now in their treatment of the dead; the benefit
which they have sought to confer upon the dead by the dissolution
of their bodies has been the re-union of body with soul and the
resumption of that active bodily life which death had for a time
suspended.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNION OF GODS AND MEN.</span></h2>
</div>



<p>The similitude of death with sleep is an idea of ancient date
and of wide distribution, which for many of mankind, whatever be
the creed professed, has mitigated the fears or lightened the uncertainties
which attach to the cessation of this life. Adopted by the
founder of the Christian religion as an illustration of the doctrine
that men ‘shall rise again with their bodies,’ the thought has
become a part of the heritage of Christendom, and in our own
language the word ‘cemetery’ bears testimony to it. But the idea
had been evolved by pagan thought long centuries before the
dawn of Christianity, and probably enough by the thinkers and
poets of many nations independently one of another. In the
oldest literature of Greece we meet with the thought already fully
developed and evidently familiar. ‘To sleep an iron slumber<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>’ is
already in Homeric language a simple and natural synonym for ‘to
die’; and so too we are told that in the far off golden age men
‘died as it were overborne by sleep<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>.’ And in yet plainer terms,
where Death and Sleep are personified, they are spoken of as twin
brethren<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a>, the children of Night<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a>. This conception seems too to
have been a favourite in art<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a>, and provided one of the scenes on
the renowned chest of Cypselus<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a>.</p>

<p>When we turn to the folk-songs of the present day, we cannot
of course hope to find the imagery of Death and Sleep pourtrayed
as infants sleeping in the lap of Night, nor indeed, so far as
I know, are they even described as brothers; for the personification
of them by the modern peasants is rare. But the old resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[544]</span>
between them is still recognised, and, quite apart from Christian
influence, the thought finds natural expression in those largely
pagan improvisations of mourning in which the name of Charon
is to be heard more frequently than the name of God. It will
suffice to quote but one stanza from one of the most simple and
touching of these funeral-songs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">δὲν εἶν’ πεθαμένη,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τὴν ὄψι τηρᾶτε,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis sleep doth enfold her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In slumber profound.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now this idea, born in some long-forgotten pagan age, fostered
by Homer and Hesiod and no less tenderly by the Christian Church,
familiar to every Greek mind for full three thousand years,
harmonizes well with the belief that body as well as soul survives
death. Beyond the superficial resemblance in the inert figures of
the dead man laid out for burial and of one who sleeps soundly,
there was another and profounder resemblance in the manner of
their waking to fresh activity, the one in this world, the other in
the under-world. Homer, with his belief that the soul alone,
survives, notes only the first resemblance. The twofold property
of laying men to sleep and of raising them therefrom resided fitly
in the wand of Hermes the escorter of the dead; but though he
escorted men’s souls to the house of Hades and might at will
summon their souls thence<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>, there is no suggestion of a bodily
awakening from the sleep of death. But Virgil, even in his close
imitation of Homer, adds to the Homeric description of Hermes’
wand one phrase of his own. ‘Therewith doth he summon forth
from Orcus the pale spirits of the dead, and others doth he send
down to gloomy Tartarus; therewith he giveth sleep and taketh
it away’&mdash;so far does Virgil follow Homer, but he adds&mdash;‘and
unsealeth men’s eyes from death<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>.’ The Homeric picture is
enriched by a new thought, foreign to the Achaean religion but
proper to that other belief which inspired Pindar’s description of
the future life, the thought that after death and dissolution, men’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[545]</span>
eyes should open upon a brighter world and a life of renewed
bodily activity.</p>

<p>Such was the thought with which the pagans of ancient
Greece had comforted themselves long before Christianity availed
itself of the same imagery. But the Hellenic religion went yet
further, and found in this thought not only peace and contentment
but vivid joy. The sleep of death was the means whereby men
should attain to closer communion with their gods. The grave
was a bed, but a bed of delight rather than of rest, a bridal bed.
They should not sleep alone, but in the very embrace of the gods
to whom in this life they had striven to draw nigh. The darkness
of the tomb was but the wedding-night. Full union in the other
world should be the consummation of partial communion in this.
The marriage of men with their gods was the ideal to which
Greek piety dared aspire.</p>

<p>Such an ideal may well seem bold even to the verge of impious
presumption. But Greek religion, even in its highest developments,
was the natural and spontaneous expression of the beliefs
and hopes of a whole people; it differed from all the great
religions of the modern world in having no founder. Great
teachers no doubt arose, as Orpheus or Pythagoras, who influenced
the course of religious thought; but they were not the founders of
new religions. The old self-grown faiths of the people were the
stocks upon which they grafted, as it would seem, even their new
doctrines; they founded schools indeed, but schools which did not
sever themselves from the received religion and become sects.
The Orphic mysteries differed so little from the old Pelasgian
mysteries of Eleusis that Orpheus was sometimes even reputed
to be their founder too; yet, as we shall see, the Eleusinian rites
were merely one presentment of a conception common to the whole
Greek people. If then this ideal of marriage between men and
gods in the future life was no invented or imported doctrine, but
simply the highest development of purely popular aspirations
towards close communion with the gods, its audacity is less surprising.
From time immemorial down to this day<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> Greece has
had its popular stories of nuptial union even in this life between
gods and mortal women, between goddesses and mortal men;
and educated Greeks, who could not credit such occurrences in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[546]</span>
their own times, might well believe that a joy, which had been
granted to the brave men and fair women of a former and better
age even during their life-time upon earth, was still reserved for
the righteous in the world to come. Pausanias tells us with
a wonderful simplicity that in his time owing to the increase of
iniquity in all the world no one was changed from a man into a god,
and that the wrath of the gods against the unrighteous was laid
up against the time when they should quit this earth<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a>. If then
there was believed to be a postponement of punishment for those
who offended the gods, there might well be a reservation of blessedness
for those who pleased them. It would have imposed no strain
upon the faith of such as Pausanias to look forward to the enjoyment
in a future life of the same bliss as had been enjoyed in old
time upon earth by men ‘who by reason of their uprightness and
piety sat at the same hospitable board as gods, and whom the gods
openly visited with honour for their goodness even as they visited
the wicked with their displeasure<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a>,’ men who, as many an old
legend told, had shared not the board only but even the bed of
deities.</p>

<p>This curious Greek conception of death as a form of marriage
was first borne in upon me by the funeral-dirges of the modern
peasants. Examples may be found in any collection of Greek
folk-songs. The actual expression of the thought varies considerably,
but it would probably be hard to find in Greece any
professional mourner in whose elaborations the idea did not occupy
an important place. It is utilised with equal frequency in regard
to persons of either sex, whether married or unmarried at the
time of death. The two following specimens from Passow’s
collection are fairly representative.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Ah me! ah me! the hours of youth and days all past and over,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haply shall they return again, those hours of youth regretted?’</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here evidently we have the funeral-dirge of an old man,
and, as is usual in these poems, a large part of the words are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[547]</span>
put into his mouth. In this fragment the first two lines are the
dead man’s complaint, the next two are an answer returned to
him, and then again he takes up his parable. The second
example which I will give is from a lamentation for a young girl.
The first few lines are addressed by the father and mother to their
dead child, and with a quaint directness contrast the gloom of the
lower world with the simple joys of a peasant’s life here above;
while the last three lines are an answer put into the dead girl’s
mouth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Dear child, there where thou purposest to hie thee down, in Hades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There, sure, no cock doth ever crow, nor hen is heard a-clucking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no spring of water found, nor grass in meadows growing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Art hungered? nought thou tastest there; athirst? there nought thou drinkest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would’st lay thee down and take thy rest? of sleep no fill thou takest.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Nay, I may not, dear father mine and mother deep-beloved,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this dirge, it may be noticed, there is no complaint on the
part of the dead girl; the lamentation and the gloomy description
of Hades are assigned to her parents. And indeed her reply is,
I think, intended to be by way of consolation. It is true that she
does not deny their cheerless prognostications nor attempt to
paint a brighter picture of the nether world, but she represents
her death as no greater breaking of old ties than is marriage;
at an actual marriage indeed the same kind of distressful presages
are chanted by the girl’s companions, and even the bride herself is
bound by propriety to exhibit a sullen and regretful demeanour.
Very true of Greek marriages and of Greek funerals is the proverb,
<span class="greek">μηδ’ ἀπὸ τὴ λύπη λείπουν γέλια μηδ’ ἀπὸ τὴ χαρὰ τὰ κλάμματα</span><a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a>,
‘Mourning hath its mirth and joy its tears.’ But the consolatory
tone is far more pronounced in some other passages from the same
collection. A good example is found in the message which
a <i>Klepht</i>&mdash;one of those patriot-outlaws who struggled against
Turkish domination&mdash;is made to send, as he lies dying, to his
mother:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[548]</span></p><div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Go, tell ye now my mother dear, my mother sore-afflicted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er to await me home again, ne’er to abide my coming;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet tell her not that I am slain, tell her not I am fallen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, tell her then that I am wed&mdash;wed in these wilds so weary.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The feeling displayed in these lines (which are credited by
Passow to the town of Livadia (<span class="greek">Λεβαδεία</span>) in Boeotia) finds closely
similar expression in a recently-published Macedonian folk-song.
The latter however is not a mere copy of the former. Its metre
is different, and further it is a folk-song of the romantic order,
whereas the lines which I have quoted belong to an historical
ballad. A youth is lowered by his brothers, so runs the story,
into a well to get water for them, but the well proves to be
haunted by a snake-like monster (<span class="greek">στοιχειό</span><a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>) from whom they try
in vain to rescue him. In this plight he cries to them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">‘Oh leave me, brothers, leave me, go ye on your way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And say not to my mother dear that I am dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">But tell her, brothers, tell her how that I am wed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The black earth for my wife I took, the tombstone my bride’s mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all these little blades of grass her brethren and her sisters<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even more remarkable in its total absence of grief is a fragment
given by Passow under the title of ‘the Wedding in Hades.’ The
lamentation&mdash;for technically at least the poem falls into the class
of ‘dirges’&mdash;is sung by a mother for her son, and she speaks
of her own mother, who is already dead and in the nether world,
as making preparation for the boy’s wedding in Hades.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘My mother maketh glad to-day, she maketh my son’s wedding,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Ye springs,” she saith, “give water cool, and give me snow, ye mountains,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From these passages and from many others conceived in the
same spirit it will readily be seen that the thought of death as
a kind of marriage, however mystical it may seem to us, is familiar
to the modern Greek peasants. Nor has that thought become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[549]</span>
crystallised into a set form of words to be repeated without heed or
understanding of their meaning. The very variety of treatment
given to the idea proves that we are not dealing with a mere
traditional expression or unmeaning commonplace, but with a
vital belief still capable of stirring the ballad-maker’s imagination.
Further it is this thought which almost alone strikes a
note of cheerfulness and of hope in the popular dirges. The usual
picture of the lower world is nothing but gloom and despair. It
is a place of darkness on which the sun never shines, a place of
ice and snow, and full of cob-webs. There are no churches there
with bright golden icons; no quoits for the young men to throw;
no looms for the women to ply. Hunger is not appeased, thirst
not quenched, and sleep is denied. All is mourning and regret
for the warm stirring life of the upper world, and anxious fears for
wife or children left behind. Happy those who are allowed even
to taste of the river of death, and to forget their homes and
orphaned little ones. Thus with strange medley of ancient and
modern is the dirge-singer wont to describe that lower world to
which all the dead without distinction go. Yet even into these
dirges, which&mdash;in order to excite the mourners to wilder displays
of grief&mdash;purposely emphasize the gloomiest aspects of death,
there is allowed to enter the one cheering thought that the
departed for whom lamentation is made is not dead nor yet fallen
on eternal sleep, but wedded in a new world; and it is worthy of
notice that it is with this thought that many of the dirges end, as
if this one consolation and hope were designed to assuage the
pangs of sorrow which the first part of the dirge had excited.</p>

<p>Thus a brief study of the modern Greek dirges reveals to us the
curious fact that a mystic conception of death is widely prevalent
among the simple-minded peasants of Greece, and that, with all
their <i>naïveté</i> in pourtraying the horrors of the lower world, it is
from a recondite doctrine that they draw consolation. How came
they to be the stewards of a doctrine so strange, so remote from
the primitive simplicity of their ordinary life?</p>

<p>Once more we must look back to a pre-Christian antiquity,
and seek again in Greek Tragedy the evidence of popular belief.
Just as Aeschylus above all others has preserved to us the awful
doctrine of future retribution for the deadly sin of blood-guilt,
so from Sophocles we may learn the more comfortable doctrine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[550]</span>
that death, while it involves a parting from friends in this
upper world, is also the means of drawing nearer, in an union
as it were of wedlock, to the denizens of the lower world. The
<i>locus classicus</i> for this conception is the <i>Antigone</i>. Throughout
the latter part of that play, when once the doom of Antigone has
been pronounced, the thought of her death as a wedding, and of
the rock-hewn tomb where she is to be immured as a bridal-chamber,
finds repeated and emphatic expression.</p>

<p>Of course it may be said that Antigone was the promised
bride of Haemon, and that the poet in speaking of her tomb as
a bridal-chamber was seeking to accentuate the pathetic contrast
between her hopes and her destiny. That is true; but perhaps it
is not the whole truth; perhaps Sophocles rather utilised the
evident pathos of the situation for the purpose of covert allusion to
doctrines which were in themselves unspeakable, such as Herodotus
would have passed over with the words <span class="greek">εὔστομα κείσθω</span>. For we
must not forget that the majority of an Athenian audience, initiated
as they naturally would be in the Eleusinian mysteries, were
familiar with religious teachings of which none might make
explicit mention in the pages of literature open to the profane,
but at which a poet might well hint in words which beneath
their superficial meaning hid a truth intelligible to such as had
ears to hear. Aeschylus indeed had once ventured too far in his
allusions to the mysteries<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a>; but there is no improbability, or
rather there is on that account an increased probability, in the
supposition that a discreet and veiled allusion to unspeakable
doctrines was permitted to the Tragic poet. Let us turn to the
actual passages of the <i>Antigone</i>.</p>

<p>The first suggestion of the thought comes ironically enough,
though it is but a faint suggestion, from the lips of Creon, who to
Ismene’s exclamation, “Wilt thou indeed bereave thine own son
of her?” retorts “’Tis Hades’ part to arrest this wedding<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a>.” The
thought is taken up later by the Chorus, who, after their
hymn in honour of unconquerable Love, revert to words of pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[551]</span>
for the woman there before them, and tell how they can no longer
check the founts of tears, when they behold Antigone drawing
near to ‘the bed-chamber where all must sleep’ (<span class="greek">τὸν παγκοίταν
θάλαμον</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a>. Here the expression of the idea is becoming plainer,
and it is no accident that the word <span class="greek">θάλαμος</span>, so commonly used of
the bride-chamber, is here selected. But yet clearer words are to
follow; for Antigone herself, in response to these words of compassion
from the Chorus, interprets more boldly that at which
they hint. ‘Me doth Hades, with whom all must sleep, bear off
yet alive to Acheron’s shore, me that have had no part in wedlock,
whose name hath never rung forth in bridal hymn, but ’tis
Acheron I shall wed<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a>.’</p>

<p>Nor does this clear pronouncement stand alone; thrice more,
as the play advances, the same thought is echoed in unmistakeable
tones. First comes the opening of that half impassioned, half
sophistic, speech of Antigone, from which some critics would
delete her argumentative estimate of a brother’s claims as against
those of a husband; but the removal of those lines would still
leave intact that outburst, ‘Oh tomb, oh bride-chamber, oh
cavernous abode of everlasting durance<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a>.’ And then again in the
speech of the messenger, who bears tidings of the fate of both
Antigone and her lover, the same thought is pressed upon us
with double insistence. First he tells how, having given Polynices
his full rites of burial, they turned to go next ‘unto the vaulted
chamber where on couch of rock the maiden should be wed with
Hades’ (<span class="greek">πρὸς λιθόστρωτον κόρης νυμφεῖον Ἅιδου κοῖλον</span>), and
from afar is heard the voice of loud lament beside ‘the bridal
chamber unhallowed by funeral rites’ (<span class="greek">ἀκτέριστον ἀμφὶ παστάδα</span><a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a>).
And later in the same narrative, when we have heard how that
voice of loud lament was stilled, Haemon is pictured as lying
dead in Antigone’s dead embrace, having won his bridal’s fulfilment
only in Hades’ house (<span class="greek">τὰ νυμφικὰ τέλη λαχὼν δείλαιος ἐν γ’
Ἅιδου δόμοις</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a>.</p>

<p>The reiteration of a single thought through all this series
of passages is most remarkable. What does it mean? Did
Sophocles intend merely to enhance the tragedy of Antigone’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[552]</span>
doom by constant comparison of that which might have been
with that which was? Or did each phrase in which the thoughts
of marriage and of death were blended contain a further and a
subtler appeal to his hearers’ emotions? Did each phrase strike
also a note which set vibrating in his listeners’ hearts responsive
chords of mystic hope?</p>

<p>For my part, as I draw near the end of these studies in Greek
religion, I find it more and more difficult to set down as mere
casual coincidences the close resemblances between Greece in the
past and Greece in the present. I have found a belief in the
supernatural beings of Ancient Greece still swaying the minds of
the modern peasants; I have seen the customs of antiquity
repeated alike in the small acts of every-day life and in the ceremonies
of its greater events; I have heard the same thoughts
expressed in almost the same turns of phrase as in ancient literature;
I have traced the popular conceptions of the present day
concerning the relations of body and soul, and their existence
after death, back to native pre-Christian sources. Have I then
not a right, am I not bound, to abjure coincidence and to claim
for the past and the present real identity? When I find in
Sophocles the same thought, almost the same words, which may
be gathered to-day from the lips of any unlettered lament-maker
the whole Greek world over, I am compelled by my conviction of
the continuity of all things Greek to believe that Sophocles
adapted to his own use a thought which in his time even as
now was uttered in many a funeral-dirge, and that while the
phrases of the <i>Antigone</i> gained in his hands a new lustre from the
pathos of their setting, they themselves were not new nor the
invention of Sophocles’ genius, but an old heritage of the Greek
race. Maybe it was that same thought which gave birth to the
strange and but partially known legend of the death of Hymenaeus
himself in the first moment of his wedded delight<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>; maybe it was
in the same spirit that Prometheus foretold how Zeus himself
should make such a marriage as should cast him down from his
throne of tyranny and he be no more seen, in fulfilment of the
curse uttered by Cronos when he was cast down into the unseen
world<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[553]</span></p>

<p>But, it may be said, the forebodings of Prometheus are generally
taken to refer to a future marriage with Thetis, not with
death; and Pindar’s reference to Hymenaeus is vague and fragmentary;
and the lines of Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i> have plenty of human
pathos, without reading into them any religious doctrine; let
your contention at least have the support of sober prose which
shows its meaning on the surface. So be it. Artemidorus in his
hand-book to the interpretation of dreams claims as a recognised
religious principle the correlation of marriage and death. To
dream of the one is commonly a prognostication of the other.
But let us hear his own words. “If an unmarried man dream of
death, it foretells his marriage; for both alike, marriage and
death, have universally been held by mankind to be ‘fulfilments’
(<span class="greek">τέλη</span>); and they are constantly indicated by one another; for
the which reason also if sick men dream of marriage, it is a
foreboding of death<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>.” And again: ‘if a sick person dream of
sexual intercourse with a god or goddess ..., it is a sign of
death; for it is then, when the soul is near leaving the body which
it inhabits, that it foresees union and intercourse with the gods<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a>.’
And yet once more: ‘since indeed marriage is akin to death and
is indicated by dreaming of death, I thought it well to touch upon
it here. If a sick man dreams of marrying a maiden, it is a sign
of his death; for all the accompaniments of marriage are exactly
the same as those of death<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a>.’ The gist of these passages is unmistakeable;
in clear and straightforward terms is enunciated the
principle that death and marriage are so intimately associated
that to dream of the one may portend the happening of the other.
Here is the doctrine which we sought to elicit from the poetry of
Sophocles and from the dirges of modern peasants, stated in plain
prosaic language. Death is akin to marriage, and, as death
approaches, men’s souls foresee a wedded union with gods.</p>

<p>But Artemidorus does not merely vouch for the existence
of this mystic doctrine; he suggests also, to those who will weigh
his words, that the doctrine was generally recognised and widely-spread:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[554]</span>
‘for all the accompaniments of marriage,’ he says, ‘are
exactly the same as those of death.’ What were these accompaniments?
Seemingly Artemidorus had in mind certain customs which
he had enumerated a little earlier, namely ‘an escort of friends,
both men and women, and garlands and scents and unguents and
an inventory of goods<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>’ (i.e. either the marriage settlement or
the last will and testament). It is then owing to this similarity
between marriage-customs and funeral-customs that ‘if a sick
man dreams of marrying a maiden, it is a sign of death.’ But
previously we heard that if a sick person dreamt of commerce
with a god or goddess, it was a sign of death, because, as death
approached, the soul foresaw union and intercourse with the gods.
How far do these statements agree? In both cases the interpretation
of the dream is the same&mdash;to dream of marriage forebodes
death&mdash;while the reasons for that interpretation are differently
given according as the partner in the dreamt-of union is divine or
human. But, though differently given, these reasons are not
mutually inconsistent. In the one case the reason assigned is an
idea&mdash;the idea that by death men were admitted to wedded
union with their gods. In the other case the reason assigned is
a custom&mdash;the custom of giving to the dead rites similar to the
marriage-rites. In effect then the two reasons assigned are one
and the same in spirit; for the ‘custom’ is merely the practical
expression of the ‘idea’; it was because men believed that the dead
attained to a wedded union with their gods, that they made the
funeral-rites resemble the rites of marriage. And clearly this
custom of assimilating the accompaniments of death to those of
marriage could never have been general, as Artemidorus suggests,
unless the belief, on which that custom was founded, had also
been generally received and widely spread.</p>

<p>It will be worth while then to institute an enquiry into the
customs generally observed both in ancient and modern times at
weddings and at funerals. Our comparison of ancient literature
with modern folk-songs, illumined by the statements of Artemidorus,
has established the fact that death and marriage were
very intimately associated in thought by some of the ancient
writers as they are by many of the modern peasants. Custom will
be found to tell the same tale, and will prove how generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[555]</span>
accepted was this idea. For in point after point which Artemidorus
does not mention in his brief enumeration&mdash;and without
reckoning, as he does, such purely business matters as the inventory
of goods&mdash;we shall find that the ceremonies incidental to
a funeral have now, and had in old time, a curiously close resemblance
to the ceremonies incidental to marriage; and, so finding,
we may be confident that they were informed by a general and
wide-spread belief that to die was but to marry into Hades’ house.
Let us review them briefly and in order<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a>.</p>

<p>The first ceremony in both functions alike was, and is, a solemn
ablution. Before a Greek wedding both bride and bridegroom
have always been required to bathe themselves, usually in water
specially fetched from some holy spring. At Athens in old time,
according to Thucydides, the spring frequented for this purpose
was Callirrhoë<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>; and similarly the Thebans had resort to the
Ismenus<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a>, the maidens of the Troad to the Scamander<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>, and the
inhabitants of other districts to some spring or river of local
repute<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>. And at the present day in Athens it is still from
Callirrhoë (when there is any water there) that the poorer classes
fill the bridal bath; while many a village has its own sacred well
or fountain (<span class="greek">ἅγι̯ασμα</span>) to which recourse is regularly had for this
same purpose. And this wedding-ablution, common, as it would
thus appear, to the Greeks of all ages, has its counterpart in the
funeral-ablution, a ceremony likewise observed in all ages. Thus
Sophocles makes Antigone speak of having washed with her own
hands the dead bodies of father, mother, and brother<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a>; and Lucian
in a mocking tone refers to the same practice as general in his
day<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a>. At the present day the same rite is practically universal
in Greece. In some places, and most notably in Crete, special
magnificence is given to the ceremony by the use of warm
wine instead of water; in others, as Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a>, the custom has
dwindled away, and all that remains of it is a perfunctory moistening
of the dead man’s face with a piece of cotton-wool soaked in
wine. But in general the old custom remains unchanged. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[556]</span>
we see that from ancient times down to the present day a ceremony
of ablution has held a place in the preliminaries alike of
a marriage and of a funeral.</p>

<p>Again in this matter of washing there is one detail of special
interest. The water for the bridal bath was in old times fetched
by a boy or girl<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> closely related to the bride or the bridegroom,
and the <span class="greek">λουτροφόρος</span>, as the bearer was called, is still an important
figure in the wedding ceremonial of the present day. Nowadays,
so far as I know, the bearer is always a boy, and further it is
essential that both his parents be still living. The <span class="greek">λουτροφόρος</span>
therefore has always been closely associated with the marriage-rite.
But in antiquity the same water-bearer appears in another
connexion. ‘It was customary,’ we hear, ‘to fetch water (<span class="greek">λουτροφορεῖν</span>)
also for those who died unmarried, and that the figure of
a water-bearer (<span class="greek">λουτροφόρον</span>) should be set up over their tomb.
The figure was that of a boy with a pitcher<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a>.’ Here we have
a clear case of the importation of a ceremony closely connected
with marriage into the funeral-rites of the unmarried. How are
we to explain this custom? On what religious conception was it
based? Clearly, it seems,&mdash;in view of that constant association of
death and marriage which we have observed in ancient literature
and modern folk-song&mdash;no other interpretation can well be
maintained than that, for those who died unwed, death itself was
the first and only marriage which they experienced, and that to
such, ere they were laid in Hades’ nuptial-chamber, there ought
to be given those same rites which were held to be a fitting preparation
for entrance into the estate of wedlock in this world<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a>.</p>

<p>The ceremonial ablutions being concluded, there came next the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[557]</span>
rites of anointing and arraying whether for marriage or for burial.
As regards the cosmetics, we might feel well assured, even without
the direct testimony of Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>, that they were freely used
in ancient weddings; and I myself have experienced a sense of
suffocation from the same cause at weddings in modern Greece.
Similarly at ancient funerals the original purpose of the <i>lecythi</i>
was without doubt to contain the choice perfumes for the anointing
of the dead<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a>; and the custom of anointing is still well known.
Then again in the matter of dress, the colour usually considered
correct<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> both for marriage and for burial was white, and, even if
this cannot be said to have been universally the case, at any rate
there was, and there still continues to be, no less pomp and
ornament in the dress of the dead body<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> than in the array of
bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>In this connexion too we may notice the use of the actual
bridal-dress in the funerals of betrothed girls and of young wives.
That this practice was known in antiquity is proved by a passage
of Chariton<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a>, in which the heroine of his story, Callirrhoë, whose
first adventure, soon after her wedding, consists in being carried
out to burial while unconscious but not dead, is described as
‘dressed in bridal array’; and exactly the same custom may be
witnessed in Greece to-day<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>. In fact not only may the person of
the dead be seen dressed as for a wedding, but in the folk-songs
we hear of the tomb itself being adorned like the home to which
the bride should have been led.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Came her lover to her bedside, stooped him down, and met her kiss;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Low and faint to his ear only, whispered she, her message this:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“When I pass away, my lover, deck thou out my tomb for me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As thou would’st have decked the home where wedded I should dwell with thee<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>.”’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet another point of coincidence between the ceremonial of
marriage and of funeral is the wearing of a crown. In ancient
times ‘chaplets,’ says Becker<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a>, ‘were certainly worn both by bride
and bridegroom,’ and in modern usage they are as essential to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[558]</span>
the marriage ceremony as the wedding-rings. At a certain point
in the service, it is the duty of the best man, assisted by the chief
bridesmaid, to keep exchanging the rings from the hands of the
bride and bridegroom, and in like manner to exchange the crowns
which they wear from the head of one to the head of the other;
and as the rings are always worn afterwards, so the two crowns
are carefully preserved and hung up together in the new home.
Equally well-established is the use of garlands in ancient funerals<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>,
and, if not quite universal at the present day<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a>, they are at any
rate commonly employed in the funerals of women and children.
In Macedonia it is actually the bridal crown which is worn
for burial by anyone who was betrothed or newly married<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a>.</p>

<p>Worthy of notice too is the not uncommon spectacle of an
apple, quince<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a>, or pomegranate laid among the flowers with which
the bier is adorned; for all these three fruits have their special
significance in relation to marriage. The classical custom of
throwing an apple into a girl’s lap as a sign of love is a method
of wooing still known to the rustic swain. It is not indeed
regarded as a highly respectable method, but perhaps neither
in old times was it so; for then, as now, the more well-conducted
youths seem to have had their wooing, if such it may be called,
carried on through the agency of an elderly lady (in ancient
Greek <span class="greek">προμνήστρια</span>, in modern <span class="greek">προξενήτρια</span>) whose negotiations
were chiefly addressed to the parents on either side, and whose
conversation smacked more of dowry than of love. The quince
and the pomegranate however are employed without any offence
to propriety. The former is in some districts the food of which
the newly-married pair are required to partake together at their
first entry into their new home; and it is hoped that the sweetness
of the fruit will so temper their lips that nothing but sweet words
will ever be addressed by the one to the other. To the open-minded
observer it might appear that acidity rather than sweetness
was the chief characteristic of the quince, and that, if the qualities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[559]</span>
of the fruit are found to affect the tones of those who eat it, they
would be better advised, as is the custom in some villages, to
substitute for the quince a well-sugared cake or a dish of honey.
But the pomegranate is far more commonly used than the quince,
and in a variety of ways. Sometimes the bride and bridegroom
eat together of it; elsewhere the bridegroom proffers it to the
bride as his first gift on her entrance to their home, and she alone
eats of it; or again she may be required to hurl it down and
scatter its seeds over the floor. The second of these methods
of using the pomegranate at marriage is, it will be remembered,
of venerable antiquity; it was a seed of this fruit which Hades
gave to Persephone to eat, that when she visited again the upper
world she might not remain there all her days with reverend,
dark-robed Demeter, but return to her home in the nether world<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a>;
and similarly at the Argive Heraeum, the bride of Zeus was
represented by Polyclitus holding in one of her hands the fruit
of the pomegranate, concerning which, says Pausanias, there is
a mystic story not to be divulged<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>. Here again then is found
the same close association of death and marriage. The three
fruits, apple, quince, and pomegranate, each of which possesses
a special use and purport in the preliminaries or the actual
ceremony of marriage, are also the fruits most commonly laid
upon the bier, in token, as it must appear, that death is but
a marriage into the unseen world. In the light of such customs
we can read with fuller understanding that simple and yet mystic
dirge, ‘The Wedding in Hades’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘My mother maketh glad to-day, she maketh my son’s wedding,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She goeth for water to the springs, for snow unto the mountains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To fruit-wives in their garden-plots for apples and for quinces...<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus in point after point the rites of marriage and the rites
of death among Greeks both past and present have been found to
coincide; and the number of these points of coincidence is too
large to admit of their being referred to accident; design is
evident. We are bound to suppose either that marriage-ceremonies
were deliberately transferred to the funeral-rite, or that
funeral-ceremonies were deliberately transferred to the marriage-rite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[560]</span>
Which supposition shall we prefer? There can be no real
question. It is impossible to conceive of a people so cynical
or so distempered as to darken the wedding-day with grim
reminders of death. But to transfer some of the usages of
marriage to the funeral-scene was to infuse one ray of hope
where all else was sorrow and darkness, to teach that, though
the dead and the mourners might grieve for their parting, yet
by that parting from the old home the dead was to enter upon
a new life, a life of wedded happiness, in the unseen world. For
indeed if there were no such intention as this, what was the
meaning of the <span class="greek">λουτροφόρος</span> set up over the grave of the unmarried,
what the purpose of adorning the dead with wedding-garment
and wedding-crown? These two acts at least are no
accidents; they reveal a studied purpose of assimilating the
usages of death to the usages of marriage; and if that purpose
underlay two of the customs enumerated, there is good warrant
for the belief that in all the coincidences between marriage-rites
and funeral-rites the same thought was operating&mdash;that very
thought which has been found to be the common property of
the Greek race, from one of the masters of ancient tragedy down
to the humblest peasant of our day. Custom past and present,
ancient literature, modern folk-song, all agree in their presentment
of death as a marriage into the house of Hades.</p>

<p>On this popular and withal recondite conception of death were
founded, I believe, the highest religious aspirations of the ancient
Greeks. Such as had served their gods piously and purely in this
life might hope to win a closer union, as of wedlock, with those gods
in the life hereafter. To them there could be neither blasphemy
nor presumption in their hope; for to pious believers the fabled
experience of their own ancestors in this life was a warrant for
aspiring themselves to the same bliss at least hereafter; what had
been, might be again. Nay, more; not only was the belief that
the highest bliss of the hereafter consisted in the marriage of men
with their gods free from all reproach of impiety, but it was the
logical development of two religious sentiments which we have
already reviewed&mdash;the desire for close communion between gods
and men, and the belief that men after death and dissolution
would still enjoy, like their gods, corporeal existence. A previous
chapter has been devoted to a detailed examination of the means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[561]</span>
whereby men in their daily life sought to maintain communication
with the powers above them&mdash;oracles from which all might enquire
and win inspired response; interpretation of the flight and cries of
birds that were the messengers of heaven; reading of the signs
written by the finger of some god on the flesh of the victim
presented to him; divination from sight and sound and dream;
sacrifice whereby some message of prayer might be sent with
speed and safety to the god who had power to fulfil it. And
in general it will, I think, be admitted that the main tendency of
Greek religious thought was to draw gods and men nearer together,
alike by an anthropomorphic conception of the gods and by an
apotheosis of human beauty; that it was to subserve this end
that Art became the handmaid of Religion, and strove to express
the divine in terms of the human, to discover in man the
potentialities of godhead. All religious hope and ambition and
effort turned upon communion with the gods. How then in the
next world should hope be fulfilled, ambition satisfied, effort
rewarded? What should be the glorious consummation? Marriage
was the closest communion between mortals in this world; marriage,
so sang the poets, bound gods together in closest communion.
Men’s aspirations for communion with their gods could find no
final satisfaction save in marriage. To the few, we may suppose&mdash;men
of refined and reflective mind, capable of imagining spiritual
joys&mdash;this marriage of men and gods was but a mystic, figurative
expression for the union of man’s soul with the soul of God, a
thought as chastened and innocent of all sensuous connotation as
the thought of many a woman who in a later era, withdrawn from
the world, has comforted her loneliness with the hope of being the
bride of Christ. But the many, I suspect, flinched not before
a bold and literal interpretation of the thought, and, believing
that, when death and physical dissolution were past, body as well
as soul survived in another world, dared dream that having passed
the gates of mortality into the demesne of the immortals they
should be wedded, body and soul, in true wedlock with those
deities who by veiled communion with them in this world
had prepared them for sight and touch and full fruition hereafter.</p>

<p>But, it will be asked, where in all Greek literature can we find
a statement, where even a hint, of this strange doctrine? No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[562]</span>where
a statement; often a hint; for these were things not
to be divulged to the profane. To those alone who were initiated
into the Mysteries was the doctrine revealed, and even to them, it
may be, in parables only whose inner meaning each must probe
for himself.</p>

<p>There have of course been those who have made light of the
mysteries of the old Greek religion, and have seen in them
nothing but the impositions of a close hierarchy playing upon the
ignorance and credulity and fear of the common-folk. But when
we consider the veneration in which the more famous mysteries
were held for many centuries, when we remember that Eleusis
was respected and left inviolate not only by the Lacedaemonians
and other Greek peoples when they invaded Attic territory, but
even by the Persians who had dared to devastate the Acropolis,
and in later times by the yet ruder Celts, then it is easier to
believe that we are dealing with a great religious institution
based upon solid principles and vital doctrines which deserved
a wide-spread and long-continued reverence from mankind, than
that it was all the elaborate and empty hoax of a crafty priesthood.</p>

<p>Nor again does the view which makes Demeter simply a corn-goddess
and the Eleusinian mysteries a portentous harvest-thanksgiving&mdash;and
that apparently somewhat premature&mdash;require any
long or serious consideration. Corn indeed was one of the blessings
given by Demeter to this upper world of living men; perhaps
in the very earliest ages of her worship this was the sum total
of the boons which men sought of her; doubtless even in her
fully-developed mysteries a part of men’s thanks were still for the
garnered harvest of the last year and for the promise which the
green fields gave of her bounty once more to be renewed; for even
in the nineteenth century of the Christian era her statue amid
the ruins of Eleusis was still associated by the peasants with
agriculture, and the removal of it, they apprehended, would cause
a failure of the crops<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a>. But in old time this was not all. To
speak of Demeter as a mere personification of cereals is to
advocate a partial truth little better than the cynical falsehood
which makes her only the stalking-horse of designing priests.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[563]</span>
For what said men of light and learning among the ancients<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a>,
men who knew the whole truth and the whole Spirit of her worship?
‘Thrice happy they of men that have looked upon these rites ere
they go to Hades’ house; for they alone there have true life, the
rest have nought there but ill<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a>.’ So Sophocles, in language
clearly recalling that of the so-called Homeric hymn<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> to Demeter;
and in harmony with him Pindar: ‘Happy he that hath seen
those rites ere he go beneath the earth; he knoweth life’s
consummation, he knoweth its god-given source<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>.’ And surely
such consummation of life should be in that paradise, where ‘mid
meadows red with roses lieth the space before the city’s gates, all
hazy with frankincense and laden with golden fruits,’ where ‘the
glorious sun sheds his light while night is here<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a>’; for to this
belief even Aristophanes subscribes, neither daring nor wishing
to make mock of the blessed ones who in the other world have
part in the god-beloved festival, and wend their way with song
and dance through the holy circle of the goddess, a lawn bright
with flowers, meadows where roses richly blossom&mdash;on whom
alone in their night-long worship the sun yet shines and a gracious
light, for that they have learnt the mysteries and dealt righteously
with all men<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>.</p>

<p>Here then are the three great masters of lyric poetry, of
tragedy, and of comedy in substantial agreement; and the hopes
which they hold out are not the mere exuberance of poetic fancy,
for sober prose affirms the same beliefs. What says Isocrates?
‘Demeter ... being graciously minded towards our forefathers
because of their services to her, services of which none but the
initiated may hear, gave us the greatest of all gifts, first, those
fruits of the earth which saved us from living the life of beasts,
and secondly, that rite which makes happier the hopes of those
that participate therein concerning both the end of life and their
whole existence; and our city proved herself not only god-beloved
but also loving toward mankind, in that, having become mistress
of such blessings, she grudged them not to the rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[564]</span>
world, but gave to all men a share in that she had received<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a>.’
Of this passage Lobeck<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> was disposed to make light, and that
for the reason that Isocrates in another passage<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a>, with less
orthodoxy perhaps and more charity, in speaking of the pious
and upright in general, employs part of the same phrase which in
the passage before us he applies to the initiated only. All good
men, he says, have happier hopes ‘concerning their whole existence’;
virtue, that is, may expect a reward, vice a punishment, either
here or hereafter. Are these fair grounds on which to condemn
his reference to the mysteries as a meaningless common-place? If
any comment is to be made upon this repetition of a well-known
phrase, would it not be fairer to note that in reference to the
mysteries he speaks of men’s happier hopes not only generally&mdash;‘concerning
their whole existence’ (<span class="greek">περὶ τοῦ σύμπαντος αἰῶνος</span>)
but also specifically&mdash;‘concerning the end of life’ (<span class="greek">περὶ τῆς τοῦ
βίου τελευτῆς</span>), and thus echoes the words of Pindar above
quoted, ‘he knoweth the consummation of life’ (<span class="greek">οἶδεν μὲν βιότου
τελευτάν</span>)? Nor is there any dearth of other authorities to prove
that it was after death that the hopes of the initiated should
‘be emptied in delight.’ Let us hear Aristides. ‘Nay, but the
benefit of the (Eleusinian) festival is not merely the cheerfulness
of the moment and the freedom and respite from all previous
troubles, but also the possession of happier hopes concerning the
end, hopes that our life hereafter will be the better, and that
we shall not lie in darkness and in filth&mdash;the fate that is believed
to await the uninitiated<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a>.’ Such seem to have been the general
terms in which the benefits of the mysteries might be recommended
to the profane. The same ideas, almost the same phrases,
occur again and again. Witness the well-known story of Diogenes
the Cynic, who, when urged by a young man to get himself
initiated, answered, ‘It is strange, my young friend, if you fancy
that by virtue of this rite the publicans will share with the gods
the good things of Hades’ house, while Agesilaus and Epaminondas
lie in filth<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a>.’ Or again let us read the advice of Crinagoras to his
friend: ‘Set thy foot on Cecropian soil, that thou may’st behold
those nights of Demeter’s great mysteries, which shall free thee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[565]</span>
from care among the living, and, when thou goest where most
are gone, shall make thy heart lighter<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>.’ And with equal
seriousness Cicero, who in his ideal state would forbid all nocturnal
rites as tending towards excesses, would except the Eleusinian
mysteries, not only because of their humanising and cheering
influence upon men’s life in this world but also because they
furnish better hopes in death<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a>.</p>

<p>Such are the most important passages bearing upon the religious
as opposed to the temporal and agricultural aspects of
Demeter’s worship, such the general terms in which the blessings
flowing therefrom were overtly described by men who knew the
details of the covert doctrine. The information contained in them
amounts to this: the initiated received in the mysteries a hope, a
pledge, perhaps a foretaste, of the future bliss reserved for them
only; the profane should lie in filth and outer darkness; the
blessed should dwell in pleasant meadows, and the sun should
shine bright upon them; they should be god-beloved, and should
share with the gods the good things of the next world.</p>

<p>Now obviously these vague and general promises are conceived
in the tone and the spirit of that popular religion which had
sprung from the very heart of the Hellenic folk. The pleasant
meadows where the initiated should dwell are none other than
that place which appears once as the asphodel mead, anon as
the islands of the blessed or as part of the under-world, and
is now named Paradise. The light which illumines even the
night-time of the blessed is the necessary contrast to the murky
gloom of a nether abode, conceived almost in the spirit of Homer,
where the profane must lie as in a slough. And finally the close
communion of the blessed with gods who love them is the consummation
of those hopes which the whole Hellenic people
entertained, and of those efforts which the whole Hellenic people
put forth, to attain to close intercourse in this life with the gods
whom they worshipped. Clearly then the general promises, whose
inner mysteries were revealed only to the initiated, were based
upon the old ideals, the innate beliefs, the traditional hopes, in
a word, the natural and spontaneous religion of the Hellenic
race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[566]</span></p>

<p>And, as at Eleusis, so probably in other mysteries. In a
famous passage Theo Smyrnaeus<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> compares the successive steps
to be taken in the study of philosophy with the several stages
of initiation in mysteries, and Lobeck<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> in his examination of the
passage has shown that the reference is not to the mysteries of
Eleusis, or at any rate not to them only. It is probable enough
that Theo was speaking of mysteries in general, both public and
private, in most of which there were, doubtless, several grades
of initiation, and he may even have selected the details of his
illustration (for it is an analogy only, not an argument, in which
he is engaged) from different rites. Yet for his fifth and final
stage of initiation, beyond even ‘open vision’ (<span class="greek">ἐποπτεία</span>) and
‘exposition’ (<span class="greek">δᾳδουχία</span> or <span class="greek">ἰεροφαντία</span>), he names that bliss which
is the outcome of the earlier stages, the bliss of being god-beloved
and sharing the life of gods (<span class="greek">ἡ κατὰ τὸ θεοφιλὲς καὶ θεοῖς
συνδιαιτὸν εὐδαιμονία</span>).</p>

<p>The recurrence of the word <span class="greek">θεοφιλής</span> in the above passages,
whether in reference to the Eleusinian or to other mysteries,
cannot but excite attention; and we shall not I think go far
astray if we take the last phrase of Theo Smyrnaeus, ‘the bliss of
being god-beloved and sharing the life of gods,’ as an epitome
of the somewhat vague and general promises held out to the
profane as an inducement to initiation. This was the fulfilment
of those ‘happier hopes’&mdash;to use another recurrent phrase&mdash;of
which the initiated might only speak in guarded fashion. The
exact interpretation of this phrase, as we shall have reason to
believe when we consider the separate rites in detail, was the
great mystic secret. But of that more anon; for the present
let us suppose that the general assurances openly given concerning
both the Eleusinian and other mysteries are fairly
summed up in the promise ‘of being god-beloved and of sharing
the life of gods.’ Such a promise appealed to those innate hopes
of the whole Greek race which manifested themselves in their
constant striving after close intercourse and communion with their
gods; in other words, the happier hopes concerning the hereafter,
which the mysteries sought to appropriate and to reserve to the
initiated alone, had for their basis the natural religion of the
Hellenic folk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[567]</span></p>

<p>To admit this is necessarily to admit the validity of Lobeck’s
refutation of those critics who have sought to father on the
mysteries, usually on those of Eleusis, doctrines and ideas foreign
to, or even incompatible with, popular Greek religion&mdash;pantheism,
the emanation of the human soul from the soul of God, the
transmigration of souls, the Platonic theory of ideas, the unity of
God omnipotent and omniscient<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a>, and such-like religious products
of different ages and different climes. For if we were to accept
the view that the teaching of the mysteries was a thing apart
from the ordinary trend and tenor of the popular religion, then
we should be compelled to regard those general promises of future
bliss (which were in truth, as we have just seen, based upon popular
religion) as a fraudulent bait designed to entice men away from
their old beliefs and to ensnare them in dogma and priestcraft;
and if any would impute fraud, there awaits them the task of
convicting Pindar, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Isocrates, and others
who wrote of that which they knew, of conspiracy to deceive.</p>

<p>But while the promises held forth by the Eleusinian and
other mysteries, and therefore also the doctrines which elucidated
those vague promises, were a product of the popular religion, those
doctrines themselves were not a matter of popular knowledge.
The very fact of initiation, the death-penalty inflicted upon the
profane who by any means penetrated to the scene of the mysteries,
the wild indignation excited in Athens by a charge of mocking
the mystic rites, the scrupulous privacy observed in investigating
that charge before a court composed of the initiated only&mdash;all
these are proofs that Eleusis was the school of secret beliefs and
hopes held in deep veneration by those to whom the knowledge of
them was vouchsafed. Secret doctrines existed; that which had
sprung from the beliefs of the many had become the property of
the few. How can this be explained?</p>

<p>The explanation is not difficult. The worship of Demeter and
possibly many other rites which were afterwards called ‘mysteries’
were the most holy part of the religion of the Pelasgians; and
when the Achaeans, a people of strange tongue and strange religion,
came among them, the Pelasgians would not admit them to a knowledge
of their rites but thenceforth performed those rites in secrecy.
This is proved by two facts. First, the rites which at Eleusis, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[568]</span>
Samothrace, and among the Cicones in Thrace, the country of
Orpheus, were imparted as mysteries to the initiated only, were in
Crete open to all and there was no obligation to secrecy concerning
them<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a>. Secondly, at Eleusis at any rate the purity required
of candidates for initiation was not only physical and spiritual,
as secured by ablution and abstinence, but also linguistic; it was
necessary <span class="greek">καθαρεύειν τῇ φωνῇ</span><a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>, to speak the Greek language
purely. These two facts taken together solve the difficulty.
Before the coming of the Achaeans the whole Pelasgian population
whether of the Greek mainland or of such an island as Crete
celebrated the rites of Demeter openly. In Crete, where no
Achaeans penetrated, the old custom naturally continued unchanged.
On the mainland the influx of a people of strange
tongue and strange religion necessitated secrecy in the native
rites, lest the presence of men who knew not Demeter should
profane her worship; the right of entry therefore at her festivals
was decided by the simplest test of Achaean or Pelasgian
nationality, the test of speech; and in later times, when the
Achaeans had acquired the Pelasgian speech<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a>, the customs thus
established were not abolished; the rites of Demeter remained
‘mysteries’ to be conducted in secret, and the Shibboleth was
still exacted.</p>

<p>Since then we may not seek in the teachings of the mysteries
anything alien from the spirit of the popular religion, the scope of
our enquiry is more limited and its course more clear. The secret
to be discovered is something which had been evolved from the
popular religion, some intensification and higher development of
those hopes and beliefs, yearnings and strivings, which have continuously
marked the religious life of the Greek folk. Now the
mass of the Greek people have always hoped and believed, as
their care for the dead has constantly shown, that beyond death
and dissolution lay a life in which body and soul should be re-united
and restored to their old activity; the mysteries might well
confirm the initiated in that expectation and picture to them the
happy habitations where they should dwell. Again the mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[569]</span>
the Greek people have always yearned and striven by manifold
means in this life for close communion with their gods; the
mysteries might well be a sacrament which afforded to the initiated
both a means and a pledge of enjoying in the next world,
to which body as well as soul should pass, the closest of all
communion with their gods, the union of wedlock.</p>

<p>Let it then be supposed that the two main ideas of the
mysteries, whether expounded in speech or represented in ritual,
were these&mdash;bodily survival after death, and marriage of men with
gods; what would have been the natural attitude of Christians
towards these doctrines? For it is in the light of the charges
brought by early Christian writers against the mysteries that such
a supposition must first be examined. The doctrine of the immortality
of the body as well as of the soul was evidently little exposed
to Christian attacks; and it may have been because the Christian
doctrine of the resurrection had much in common with the old
Greek doctrine, that St Paul found among his audience on the
Areopagus some who did not mock, but said ‘We will hear thee
again of this matter.’ But with the further doctrine of marriage
between men and gods Christianity could have no sympathy, but
would inevitably regard it as offensive both in theology and in
morality, as implying the existence of a plurality of gods, and as
savouring of that sensuality, which above all other sin the apostle
to the Gentiles set himself to combat.</p>

<p>And it is in fact upon these two points that the mass of the
accusations brought by early Christian writers against Greek
paganism hinge and hang. These were the points at which
Greek religion seemed to its assailants most readily vulnerable,
and against which they sought to use as weapons the very language
of paganism itself. Just as Clement of Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> seeks to prove
out of the mouth of Homer, who speaks of the gods in general as
<span class="greek">δαίμονες</span><a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a>, that the Greek gods are confessedly mere <i>demons</i> (for
the word <span class="greek">δαίμων</span> had seemingly deteriorated in meaning), that is
to say, abominable and unclean spirits, enemies of the one true
God, so too the words <span class="greek">ἄρρητος</span> and <span class="greek">ἀπόρρητος</span>, used by the pagans
of their ‘unspeakable’ mysteries, were misinterpreted by the
Christians with one consent and became a handle for convicting
the old religion of ‘unnameable’ impurities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[570]</span></p>

<p>With the question of polytheism however we are not further
concerned; whether the Hellenic gods were true gods, as their
worshippers held, or devils, as Clement thought, or non-existent, as
many will think to-day, matters not; all that we need to know in
this respect is known, namely, that the mysteries, like the popular
religion, acknowledged a plurality of gods; for in the Eleusinian
drama alone several gods played a part. It is rather the frequent
and violent charges of impurity which call for investigation.</p>

<p>A few examples will suffice for the present. A comprehensive
denunciation is that of Eusebius, who charges the pagans with
celebrating, ‘in chant and hymn and story and in the unnameable
rites of the mysteries, adulteries and yet baser lusts, and
incestuous unions of mother with son, brother with sister<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a>.’ And
again he says, ‘In every city rites and mysteries of gods are
taught, in harmony with the mythical stories of old time, so that
even now in these rites, as well as in hymns and odes to the gods,
men can hear of marriages of the gods, and of their procreation of
children, and of dirges for death, and of drunken excesses, and of
wanderings, and of passionate love or anger<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>.’ Equally outspoken
is Clement of Alexandria in his ‘Exhortation to the heathen.’
Some specific statements in that work concerning the mysteries of
several gods, though they support the general charges of impurity,
may be postponed for later examination. It will be enough here
to adduce the phrases in which, after denouncing those who,
whether in the mysteries of the temples or the paintings with
which their own houses were adorned, loved to look upon the lusts
of gods (he risks even the word <span class="greek">πασχητιασμοί</span>), and ‘regarded
incontinence as piety,’ Clement reaches the climax of his invective:&mdash;‘Such
are your models of voluptuousness, such your
creeds of lust, such the doctrines of gods who commit fornication
with you; for, as the Athenian orator says, what a man wishes,
that he also believes<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a>.’ This brutal directness of Clement is
however hardly more effective than the elegant innuendo of
Synesius in dealing with the same subject. Commenting on the
secrecy of the nocturnal rites, he describes them as celebrated at
‘times and places competent to conceal <span class="greek">ἀρρητουργίαν ἔνθεον</span><a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>’&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">[571]</span>
phrase which I despair of rendering, for the ‘unspeakable acts’
to which ‘divine frenzy’ led, are those which are either too holy
or too infamous to be named.</p>

<p>These few typical passages amply demonstrate that alike by
insinuation and by open accusation the Christian writers conspired
to brand the mysteries with the infamy of deeds unnameable.
What is the explanation of this organised campaign of calumny?</p>

<p>Some have supposed that the Christian writers in general
confused the public and the private mysteries, and that, aware
of the license which characterized the latter, they included all
in one condemnation. But this explanation appears at any rate
inadequate. We have seen how Cicero distinguished sharply
between the Eleusinian mysteries, in which he had participated
and for which he felt reverence, and other nocturnal rites which
gave shelter to all manner of excess. It is difficult therefore to
suppose that in later times the Christian writers should all have
fallen unwittingly into the error of confusing all mysteries together;
and no less difficult to imagine that, if they recognised
how far removed were the most respected of the public mysteries
from the baser private orgies, they should have deliberately exposed
themselves to the charge of ignorance of the subject concerning
which they presumed to preach. Clement of Alexandria was too
shrewd a disputant so to stultify himself.</p>

<p>Nor again is it a sufficient explanation to say that the strain
and excitement of such mysteries as those of Eleusis were responsible
for a certain amount of subsequent indiscretion. Let it
be granted that many of those who had witnessed the solemn rites
were guilty afterwards of drunkenness and licentiousness<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a>; yet
these would be no grounds for convicting the mysteries themselves
of impurity; to so perverted a charge the heathen might well
have answered that rioting and drunkenness had not been unknown
at the Christians’ most solemn service; and indeed the
same argument could up to this day be used against the Greek
celebration of Easter. No; the charges of impurity were brought
against the mysteries themselves, not against the incidental misdoings
of some who had witnessed them. It must have been
either the doctrines taught or the dramatic representations by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[572]</span>
means of which they were taught that furnished the Christian
writers with a handle for accusation.</p>

<p>Now if, as I have supposed, the doctrine of the marriage of
men with their gods was the cardinal doctrine of the mysteries
(for the other doctrine of bodily survival is merely preliminary
and subordinate to this), and if some dramatic representation was
given as a means of instilling into men’s minds the hope of attaining
to that summit of bliss, it is not difficult to see what an
opening the mysteries gave to their opponents for the charges
which were actually brought. The ultimate bliss promised to the
initiated was in general terms said to consist in ‘being god-beloved
and dwelling with the gods,’ and this phrase, we are
supposing, signified to the initiated themselves an assurance that
their gods would admit them even to wedlock with them in the
future life. It required then no great ingenuity in the way of
misrepresentation for Clement, if he had but an inkling of the
secret doctrine, to denounce the heathen and their beliefs in that
opprobrious phrase, ‘Such are the doctrines of gods that commit
fornication with you.’ This champion of Christianity knew no
chivalry, gave no quarter, disdained no weapon, held no method of
attack too base or insidious, if only he could wound and crush his
heathen foes. It was his part to pervert, to degrade, to blaspheme
their whole religion; and that which they held most sacred was
marked out for his most virulent scorn. Naturally to those who
drew near with pure and reverent minds the mysteries wore a very
different aspect. That which Clement misnamed lust, they felt
to be love; where he saw only degradation, they recognised a wonderful
condescension of their gods. For in the words of that
religion which Clement preached ‘to the pure all things are pure’;
and it was purification which the initiated sought by abstinence
and ablution during the first part of the Eleusinian festival before
they were admitted to their holy of holies.</p>

<p>Indeed if we would understand at all the spirit in which the
ancient Greeks approached the celebration of the mysteries, we
should do well to turn our attention for a little to the modern
Greek celebration of Holy Week and Easter; for this is, so to
speak, the Christian counterpart of the old mysteries, and seems to
owe much to them. It so happens that Easter falls in the same
period of the year as did the great Eleusinian festival&mdash;the period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[573]</span>
when the re-awakening of the earth from its winter sleep suggests
to man his own re-awakening from the sleep of death; and it is
probable that the Church turned this coincidence in time to good
account by making her own festival a substitute for the festival of
Demeter or other kindred rites, and even by modelling her own
services after the pagan pattern; for it would seem that the
Church, when once her early struggles had secured her a firm
position, exchanged hostility for conciliation, and sought to absorb
rather than to oust paganism. Her complaisance is clearly seen in
the ceremonies of Good Friday and Easter; for, with all her severe
repression of the use of idols (whose place however is well supplied
by the pictures which are called icons), she has permitted the use
of a sculptured figure at this one festival, and even down to this
day Christ is represented in some localities<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> in effigy; and it can
hardly be doubted that the purpose of this concession was to make
the Christian festival as dramatic and attractive as the pagan
mysteries celebrated at the same season. Again the absorption
of pagan ideas is well illustrated by the belief still prevalent
among the peasants that the Easter festival, like the cult of
Demeter, has an important bearing upon the growth of the crops.
A story in point was told to me by one who had travelled in
Greece<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a>. Happening to be in some village of Eubœa during Holy
Week, he had been struck by the emotion which the Good Friday
services evoked; and observing on the next day the same general
air of gloom and despondency, he questioned an old woman about
it; whereupon she replied, ‘Of course I am anxious; for if Christ
does not rise to-morrow, we shall have no corn this year.’</p>

<p>In other details too there is a close correspondence between
the pagan and the Christian festivals. As a period of
abstinence was required of the <i>mystae</i>, so during Lent and still
more strictly during Holy Week the Greek peasants keep a fast
which certainly predisposes them to hysterical emotion during the
services; and <i>en revanche</i>, just as the initiated are said to have
indulged themselves too freely when the mysteries were over, so
the modern peasants, when the announcement of the Resurrection
has been made, disperse in haste to feast upon their Easter lamb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[574]</span>
and while it is still a-cooking experience the inevitable effects of
plentiful wine on an empty stomach. Again, just as the rites of
Eleusis were nocturnal, so the chief services of Holy Week are
those of the Friday night and the Saturday night; and it may be
that the torch-light processions which close the services on those
two nights are related to the <span class="greek">δᾳδουχία</span> of Eleusis. But these are
minor details; it is in the actual services of Good Friday and
Easter that the most striking resemblance to the Eleusinian
mysteries is found, and the spirit in which the worshippers
approach may still be the same now as then. Let me briefly
describe the festival as I saw it in the island of Santorini, or, to
give it the old name which has revived in modern times, Thera.</p>

<p>The Lenten fast was drawing to a close when I arrived. For the
first week it is strictly observed, meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and
even olive-oil being prohibited, so that the ordinary diet is reduced
to bread and water, to which is sometimes added a nauseous soup
made from dried cuttle-fish or octopus; for these along with shellfish
are not reckoned to be animal food, as being bloodless. During
the next four weeks some relaxation is allowed; but no one with
any pretensions to piety would even then partake of fish, meat, or
eggs; the last-mentioned are stored up until Easter and then,
being dyed red, are either eaten or&mdash;more wisely&mdash;offered to
visitors. Then comes ‘the Great Week’ (<span class="greek">ἡ μεγάλη ἑβδομάδα</span>),
and with it the same strict regulations come into force as during
the first week of Lent. It was not hard to perceive that for most
of the villagers the fast had been a real and painful abstinence.
Work had almost ceased; for there was little energy left. Leisure
was not enjoyed; for there was little spirit even for chatting.
Everywhere white, sharp-featured faces told of real hunger; and
the silence was most often broken by an outburst of irritability.
In a few days time I could understand it; for I too perforce
fasted; and I must own that a daily diet of dry bread for <i>déjeuner</i>
and of dry bread and octopus soup for dinner soon changed my
outlook upon life. Little wonder then if these folk after six weeks
of such treatment were nervous and excitable.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of body and mind in which they
attended the long service of Good Friday night. Service I have
said, but drama were a more fitting word, a funeral-drama. At
the top of the nave, just below the chancel-step, stood a bier and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[575]</span>
upon it lay the figure of the Christ, all too death-like in the dim
light. The congregation gaze upon him, reverently hushed, while
the priests’ voices rise in prayer and chant as it were in lamentation
for the dead God lying there in state. Hour after hour
passes. The women have kissed the dead form, and are gone.
The moment has come for carrying the Christ out to burial. The
procession moves forward&mdash;in front, the priests with candles and
torches and, guarded by them, the open bier borne shoulder-high&mdash;behind,
a reverent, bare-headed crowd. The night is dark and
gusty. It rains, and the rugged, tortuous alleys of the town are
slippery. It is late, but none are sleeping. Unheeding of wind
and rain, the women kneel at open door or window, praying,
swinging censers, sprinkling perfume on the passing bier. Slowly,
haltingly, led by the dirge of priests, now in darkness, now lighted
by the torches’ flare and intermittent beams from cottage doorways,
groping at corners, stumbling in ill-paved by-ways, the
mourners follow their God to his grave. The circuit of the town
is done. All have taken their last look upon the dead. The
sepulchre is reached&mdash;a vault beneath the church from which the
funeral started. The priests alone enter with the bier. There is
a pause. The crowd waits. The silence is deep as the darkness,
only broken here and there by a deep-drawn sigh. Is it the last
depth of anguish, or is it well-nigh relief that the long strain is
over? The priests return. In silence the crowd have waited, in
silence they disperse. It is finished.</p>

<p>But there is a sequel on the morrow. Soon after dark on
Easter-eve the same weary yet excited faces may be seen gathered
in the church. But there is a change too; there is a feeling
abroad of anxiety, of expectancy. Hours must yet pass ere midnight,
and not till then is there hope of the announcement, ‘Christ
is risen!’ The suspense seems long. To-night there is restlessness
rather than silence. Some go to and fro between the church
and their homes; others join discordantly in the chants and misplace
the responses; anything to cheat the long hours of waiting.
Midnight draws near; from hand to hand are passed the tapers
and candles which shall light the joyful procession, if only the
longed-for announcement be made. What is happening there
now behind those curtains which veil the chancel from the
expectant throng? Midnight strikes. The curtains are drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[576]</span>
back. Yes, there is the bier, borne but yesternight to the grave.
It is empty. That is only the shroud upon it. The words of the
priest ring out true, ‘Christ is risen!’ And there behind the
chancel, see, a second veil is drawn back. There in the sanctuary,
on the altar-steps, bright with a blaze of light stands erect the
figure of the Christ who, so short and yet so long a while ago, was
borne lifeless to the tomb. A miracle, a miracle! Quickly from
the priest’s lighted candle the flame is passed. In a moment the
dim building is illumined by a lighted taper in every hand. A
procession forms, a joyful procession now. Everywhere are light
and glad voices and the embraces of friends, crying aloud the news
‘Christ is risen’ and answering ‘He is risen indeed.’ In every
home the lamb is prepared with haste, the wine flows freely; in
the streets is the flash of torches, the din of fire-arms, and all the
exuberance of simple joy. The fast is over; the dead has been
restored to life before men’s eyes; well may they rejoice even to
ecstasy. For have they not felt the ecstasy of sorrow? This was
no tableau on which they looked, no drama in which they played
a part. It was all true, all real. The figure on the bier was
indeed the dead Christ; the figure on the altar-steps was indeed
the risen Christ. In these simple folk religion has transcended
reason; they have reached the heights of spiritual exaltation;
they have seen and felt as minds more calm and rational can
never see nor feel.</p>

<p>And the ancient Greeks, had not they too the gift of ecstasy,
the faculty to soar above facts on the wings of imagination?
When the drama of Demeter and Kore was played before the eyes
of the initiated at Eleusis, were not they too uplifted in mind until
amid the magic of night they were no longer spectators of a drama
but themselves had a share in Demeter’s sorrow and wandering and
joy? For the pagan story is not unlike the Christian story in its
power to move both tears and gladness. As now men mourn
beside the bier of Christ, so in old time may men have shared
Demeter’s mourning for her child who though divine had suffered
the lot of men and passed away to the House of Hades. As now
men rejoice when they behold the risen Christ, so in old time may
men have shared Demeter’s joy when her child returned from
beneath the earth, proving that there is life beyond the grave.
But the old story taught more than this. Not only did Kore live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[577]</span>
in the lower world, but her passing thither was not death but
wedding. Therefore just as now the resurrection of Christ, who
though divine is the representative of mankind, is held to be an
earnest of man’s resurrection, so the wedded life of Kore in the
nether world may have been to the initiated an assurance of the
same bliss to be vouchsafed to them hereafter.</p>

<p>What was there then in this drama of Demeter and Kore at
which the Christian writers could take offence or cavil? We do
not of course know in what detail the story was represented; but
the pivot on which the whole plot turned was necessarily the rape
of Kore. Now it appears that in the play the part of Aïdoneus
was taken by an hierophant and the part of Kore by a priestess;
and it was the alleged indecency resulting therefrom which the
fathers of the Church most severely censured. Asterius, after
defending the Christians from the charge of worshipping saints as
if they had been not human but divine, seeks to turn the tables
on his pagan opponents by accusing them of deifying Demeter and
Kore, whom he evidently regards as having once been human
figures in mythology. Then he continues, ‘Is not Eleusis the
scene of the descent into darkness, and of the solemn acts of intercourse
between the hierophant and the priestess, alone together?
Are not the torches extinguished, and does not the large, the
numberless assembly of common people believe that their salvation
lies in that which is being done by the two in the darkness<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>?’
Again it was objected against the Valentinians by Tertullian that
they copied ‘the whoredoms of Eleusis<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>,’ and from another
authority we learn that part of the ceremonies of these heretics
consisted in ‘preparing a nuptial chamber’ and celebrating ‘a
spiritual marriage<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a>.’ These two statements, read in conjunction,
form a strong corroboration of the information given by Asterius;
and we are bound to conclude that the scene of the rape of Kore
was represented at Eleusis by the descent of the priest and
priestess who played the chief parts into a dark nuptial chamber.</p>

<p>Now it is easy enough to suppose, as Sainte-Croix suggests<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a>,
that public morals were safeguarded by assigning the chief <i>rôles</i> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[578]</span>
the drama to persons of advanced age, or, as one ancient author
states<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a>, by temporarily and partially paralysing the hierophant
with a small dose of hemlock. Whether each of the initiated was
at any time conducted through the same ritual is uncertain. In
the formulary of the Eleusinian rites, as recorded by Clement of
Alexandria&mdash;‘I fasted; I drank the sacred potion (<span class="greek">κυκεῶνα</span>); I
took out of the chest; having wrought (<span class="greek">ἐργασάμενος</span>) I put back
into the basket and from the basket into the chest<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>’&mdash;the expression
‘having wrought’ has been taken to be an euphemism
denoting the same mystic union as between hierophant and
priestess<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a>. If this view is correct, it would imply no doubt that
full initiation required the candidate to go through the whole
ritual in person; in this case it must be presumed that some
precaution such as the dose of hemlock was taken in the interests
of morality.</p>

<p>But the mere fact that a scene of rape should form any part of
a religious rite, was to the Christians a stumbling-block. This
was their insurmountable objection to the mysteries, and they
were only too prone to exaggerate a ceremony, which with
reverent and delicate treatment need have been in no way morally
deleterious, into a sensual and noxious orgy. The story, how
Demeter’s beautiful and innocent daughter was suddenly carried
off from the meadow where she was gathering flowers into the
depths of the dark under-world, spoke to them only of the violence
and lust of her ravisher Aïdoneus. But the legend might bear
another complexion. Kore, as representative of mankind or at
least of the initiated among mankind, suffers what seems the most
cruel lot, a sudden departure from this life in the midst of youth
and beauty and spring-time; and Demeter searches for her awhile
in vain, and mourns for her as men mourn their dead. Yet afterward
it is found that there is no cruelty in Kore’s lot, for she is
the honoured bride of the king of that world to which she was
borne away; and Demeter is comforted, for her child is not dead
nor lost to her, but is allowed to return in living form to visit her.
What then must have been the ‘happier hopes’ held out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[579]</span>
those who had looked on the great drama of Eleusis? What was
meant by that prospect of being ‘god-beloved and sharing the
life of gods’? How came it that the assembly of the initiated
believed their salvation to lie in the union of Hades and Persephone,
represented in the persons of hierophant and priestess, in
the subterranean nuptial-chamber? What was the bearing of the
legend dramatically enacted upon these hopes and prospects and
beliefs? Surely it taught that not only was there physical life
beyond death, but a life of wedded happiness with the gods.</p>

<p>And the same doctrine seems to be the <i>motif</i> of many other
popular legends and of mysteries founded thereon; its settings
and its harmonies may be different, but the essential melody is
the same. At Eleusis Demeter’s daughter was the representative
of mankind, for she went down to the house of Hades as is the lot
of men. But Crete had another legend wherein Demeter was the
representative deity with whom mankind might hope for union.
Was it not told how Iasion even in this life found such favour in
the goddess’ eyes that she was ‘wed with him in sweet love mid
the fresh-turned furrows of the fat land of Crete<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a>’? And happiness
such as was granted to him here was laid up for all the
initiated hereafter; else would there be no meaning in those lines,
‘Blessed, methinks, is the lot of him that sleeps, and tosses not,
nor turns, even Endymion; and, dearest maiden, blessed I call
Iasion, whom such things befell, as ye that be profane shall never
come to know<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a>.’ Surely that which is withheld from the profane
is by implication reserved to the sanctified, and to them it is
promised that they shall know by their own experience hereafter
the bliss which Iasion even here obtained. It was, I think, in
this spirit and this belief that the Athenians in old time called
their dead <span class="greek">Δημητρεῖοι</span> ‘Demeter’s folk<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>’; for the popular belief in
the condescension of the Mistress, great and reverend goddess
though she was, was so firmly rooted, it would seem, that even to
this day the folk-stories, as we have seen, still tell how the
‘Mistress of the earth and of the sea,’ she whom men still call
Despoina and reverence for her love of righteousness and for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[580]</span>
stern punishment of iniquity, has yet admitted brave heroes to
her embrace in the mountain-cavern where, as of old in Arcady,
she still dwells<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor did the cults of Demeter and Kore monopolise these hopes
and beliefs. In the religious drama of Aphrodite and Adonis, in
the Sabazian mysteries, in the holiest rites of Dionysus, in the wild
worship of Cybele, the same thought seems ever to recur. It
matters little whether these gods and their rites were foreign or
Hellenic in origin. If they were not native, at least they were soon
naturalised, and that for the simple reason that they satisfied the
religious cravings of the Greek race. The essential spirit of their
worship, whatever the accidents of form and expression, was the
spirit of the old Pelasgian worship of Demeter; and therefore,
though Dionysus may have been an immigrant from northern
barbarous peoples, the Greeks did not hesitate to give him room
and honour beside Demeter in the very sanctuary of Eleusis.
Similar, we may well believe, was the lot of other foreign gods and
rites. Whencesoever derived, they owed their reception in Greece
to the fact that their character appealed to certain native religious
instincts of the Greek folk. Once transplanted to Hellenic soil,
they were soon completely Hellenized; those elements which were
foreign or distasteful to Greek religion were quickly eradicated or
of themselves faded into oblivion, while all that accorded with the
Hellenic spirit throve into fuller perfection; for the character of
a deity and of a cult depends ultimately upon the character of the
worshippers.</p>

<p>It is fair therefore to treat of Aphrodite as of a genuinely
Greek deity; for, though she may have entered Greece from
Eastern lands, doubtless long before the Homeric age her worship
no less than her personality was permeated with the spirit
of genuinely Greek religion. Too well known to need re-telling
here is the story of how&mdash;to use the words of Theocritus once
more&mdash;‘the beautiful Cytherea was brought by Adonis, as he
pastured his flock upon the mountain-side, so far beyond the
verge of frenzy, that not even in his death doth she put him from
her bosom<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a>.’ Such was the plot of one of the most famous religious
dramas of old time. And what was its moral for those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[581]</span>
had ears to hear? Surely that the beloved of the gods may hope
for wedlock with them in death.</p>

<p>It was certainly in this sense that Clement of Alexandria
understood certain other mysteries of Aphrodite, though, needless
to say, he puts upon them the most obscene construction.
After relating in terms unnecessarily disgusting the legend of
how by the very act of Uranus’ self-mutilation the sea became
pregnant and gave birth from among its foam to the goddess
Aphrodite, he states that ‘in the rites which celebrate this
voluptuousness of the sea, as a token of the goddess’ birth
there are handed to those that are being initiated into the
lore of adultery (<span class="greek">τοῖς μυουμένοις τὴν τέχνην τὴν μοιχικήν</span>) a lump
of salt and a phallus; and they for their part present her with
a coin, as if they were her lovers and she their mistress (<span class="greek">ὡς ἑταίρας
ἐρασταί</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a>.’ Thus Clement; but those who are willing to see in
the mysteries of the Greek religion something more than organised
sensuality will do well to reflect whether that which Clement calls
‘being initiated into the lore of adultery’ was not really an initiation
into those hopes of marriage with the gods of which we have
already found evidence in the popular religion, and whether the
goddess’ symbolic acceptance of her worshippers as lovers does not
fit in exactly with that bold conception of man’s future bliss. The
symbolism indeed, if Clement’s statement is accurate, was crude
and even repellent, but its significance is clear; and those who
approached these mysteries of Aphrodite in reverent mood need not
have been repelled by that which modern taste would account
indecent in the ritual. Greek feeling never erred on the side
of prudery; men were familiar with the <i>Hermae</i> erected in the
streets and with the symbolism of the <i>phallus</i> in religious ceremonies,
and tolerated the publication of literature&mdash;be it the
comedy of Aristophanes or Clement’s own exhortation to the
heathen&mdash;which neither as a source of amusement nor of instruction
would be tolerated now.</p>

<p>The particular mysteries to which Clement alludes in this
passage seem to have been concerned with the story of Aphrodite’s
birth, and though it is difficult to conjecture how that story can
have been made to illustrate and to inculcate the doctrine of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[582]</span>
marriage of men and gods, the information given by Clement with
respect to the ritual makes it clear that such was their object. But
in that other rite of the same goddess, that namely which celebrated
the story of Adonis, the whole <i>motif</i> of the drama was the
continuance of Aphrodite’s love for him after his death, a love so
strong that it prevailed upon the gods of the lower world to let
him return for half of every year to the upper world and the arms
of his mistress. Here, though expressed in different imagery, is
the same doctrine as that which underlay the drama of Eleusis.
Here again is an illustration, or rather, for those who were capable
of religious ecstasy, a proof, of the doctrine that the dead yet lived,
and in that life were both in body and in soul one with their gods.
For ‘thrice-beloved Adonis who even in Acheron is beloved<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a>’
was the type and forerunner of all those who had part in his
mysteries.</p>

<p>In another version this legend of Adonis is brought into even
closer relation with the Eleusinian mysteries by the introduction
of Persephone<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a>. To her is assigned the part of a rival to Aphrodite,
and being equally enamoured of the beautiful Adonis she is
glad of his death whereby he is torn from the arms of Aphrodite
in the upper world, and enters the chamber of the nether world
where her love in turn may have its will; but in the end
Aphrodite descends to the house of Hades, and a compact is
arranged between the two goddesses by which each in turn may
possess Adonis for half the year. This version of the story is
cruder, but its teaching is obviously the same&mdash;Adonis, the favourite
of heaven in this life, and the precursor of all who by initiation in
the mysteries win heaven’s favour, survives in the lower world
with both body and soul unimpaired by death, and is admitted
to wedlock with the great goddess of the dead.</p>

<p>The same doctrine again seems to have been the basis of certain
mystic rites associated with Dionysus. From the speech against
Neaera attributed to Demosthenes we learn that at Athens there
was annually celebrated a marriage between the wife of the chief
magistrate (<span class="greek">ἄρχων βασιλεύς</span>) and Dionysus. The solemnity was
reckoned among things ‘unspeakable’; foreigners were not per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[583]</span>mitted
to see or to hear anything of it; and even Athenian
citizens, it seems, might not enter the innermost sanctuary in
which the union of Dionysus with the ‘queen’ (<span class="greek">βασίλιννα</span>) was
celebrated<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a>. There were however present and assisting in some
way fourteen priestesses (<span class="greek">γεραραί</span>), dedicated to the service of the
god and bound by special vows of chastity. These priestesses, we
are told, corresponded in number to the altars of Dionysus<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a>, and
they were appointed by the archon whose wife was wed with
Dionysus<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>. There our actual knowledge of the facts ends; but
there is material enough on which to base a rational surmise.
The correspondence between the number of priestesses bound by
vows of purity and the number of the altars suggests that in this
custom is to be sought a relic of human sacrifice. The selection
of the priestesses by the magistrate who held the title of ‘king’
suggests that in bygone times it had been the duty of the king, as
being also chief priest, to select fourteen virgins who should be
sacrificed on Dionysus’ altars and thereby sent to him as wives.
Subsequently maybe, as humanity gradually mitigated the wilder
rites of religion, the number of victims was reduced to one; and
later still the human sacrifice was altogether abolished, and, instead
of sending to Dionysus his wife by the road of death, the
still pious but now more humane worshippers of the god contented
themselves with a symbolic marriage between him and the wife of
their chief magistrate.</p>

<p>The conception of human sacrifice as a means of sending a
messenger from this world to some power above, which receives
clear expression in that modern story from Santorini which I have
narrated in an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a>, was, I have there argued, known
also to the ancient Greeks; and the same means of communication
may equally well have been employed for the despatch of a
human wife to some god. Plutarch appears to have been actually
familiar with this idea. In a passage in which he is attempting
to vindicate the purity and goodness of the gods and, it must be
added withal, their aloofness from human affairs, he claims that
all the religious rites and means of communion are concerned,
not with the great gods (<span class="greek">θεοί</span>), but with lesser deities (<span class="greek">δαίμονες</span>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[584]</span>
who are of varying character, some good, others evil, and
that the rites also vary accordingly. “As regards the mysteries,”
he says, “wherein are given the greatest manifestations or representations
(<span class="greek">ἐμφάσεις καὶ διαφάσεις</span>) of the truth concerning
‘daemons,’ let my lips be reverently sealed, as Herodotus has
it”; but the wilder orgies of religion, he argues, are to be set
down as a means of appeasing evil ‘daemons’ and of averting
their wrath; the human sacrifices of old time, for example, were
not demanded nor accepted by gods, but were performed to satisfy
either the vindictive anger of cruel and tormenting ‘daemons,’ or
in some cases “the wild and despotic passions (<span class="greek">ἔρωτας</span>) of ‘daemons’
who could not and would not have carnal intercourse with carnal
beings. Just as Heracles besieged Oechalia to win a girl, so these
strong and violent ‘daemons,’ demanding a human soul that is
shut up within a body, and being unable to have bodily intercourse
therewith, bring pestilences and famines upon cities and
stir up wars and tumults, until they get and enjoy the object of
their love.” And reversely, he continues, some ‘daemons’ have
punished with death men who have forced their love upon them;
and he refers to the story of a man who violated a nymph and
was found afterwards with his head severed from his body<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a>. The
whole passage betrays clearly enough what was the popular belief
which Plutarch here set himself so to explain as to safeguard the
goodness of the gods; but perhaps the end of it is the most
significant of all. Plutarch forgets that a nymph, if she is a
‘daemon,’ is by his own hypothesis incapable of bodily intercourse;
in this case then his attempted explanation is not even logically
sound, and his conception of a purely spiritual ‘daemon’ is a
failure; but at the same time, save for this invention, he is following
the popular belief of both ancient and modern Greece that
carnal intercourse between man and nymph is possible but is
fraught with grave peril to the man<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>. It is impossible then to
doubt that in the earlier part of the passage he was explaining
away a popular belief by means of the same hypothesis. He himself
would hold that spiritual ‘daemons’ demanded human sacrifice
because they lusted after a soul or spirit confined out of their
reach in a body until death severed it therefrom; but the popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[585]</span>
belief, which he is at pains to emend, was that corporeal gods
demanded human sacrifice because they lusted after the person
who, by death, would be sent, body and soul, to be wed with them.</p>

<p>There is good reason then to suppose that in old time death may
have been even inflicted as the means of effecting wedlock between
men and gods; and that the mystic rite of union between Dionysus
and the wife of the Athenian magistrate was based on the same
fundamental idea as the mysteries of Demeter and Persephone or
of Aphrodite. Though in this instance, when once human sacrifice
had been given up, all suggestion of death was, so far as we
know, removed from the solemnity, yet the repetition year by year
of a ceremony of marriage between the god and a mortal woman
representing his worshippers might still keep bright in their
minds those ‘happier hopes’ of the like bliss laid up for themselves
hereafter.</p>

<p>This particular rite escaped the notice, or at any rate the
malice, of Clement; but Dionysus does not for all that go unscathed.
Clement fastens upon a legend concerning him, which,
however widely ancient Greek feeling in the matter of sex differed
from modern, cannot but have seemed to some of the ancients<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>
themselves to be a reproach and stain upon the honour of their
god. The story of Dionysus and Prosymnus, as told by Clement<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a>,
must be taken as read. But those who will investigate it for
themselves will see that the same idea of death being followed
by close intercourse with the gods is present there also. That
this was the inner meaning of the peculiarly offensive story is
shown by a curious comment of Heraclitus upon it, which Clement
quotes&mdash;<span class="greek">ωὐτὸς δε Ἀίδης καὶ Διόνυσος</span><a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a>, ‘Hades and Dionysus are
one’; whence it follows that union with Dionysus is a synonym
for that ‘marriage with Hades’ which elsewhere, in both ancient
and modern times, is a common presentment of death.</p>

<p>Again in the Sabazian mysteries, which some connect with
Dionysus and others with Zeus, the little that is known of the ritual
favours the view that here also the <i>motif</i> was the marriage of the
deity with his worshippers. According to Clement<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a>, the subject-matter
of these mysteries was a story that Zeus, having become by
Demeter the father of Persephone, seduced in turn his own daughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">[586]</span>
having as a means to that end transformed himself into a snake.
That story, it may safely be said, is presented by Clement in its
worst light; but the statement, that in the ritual the deity was
represented by a snake, obtains some corroboration from Theophrastus,
who says of the superstitious man, that if he see a red
snake in his house he will invoke Sabazius<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a>. Now the token of
these mysteries for those who were being initiated in them was,
according to Clement<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> again, ‘the god pressed to the bosom’ (<span class="greek">ὁ διὰ
κόλπου θεός</span>); which phrase he explains by saying that the god
was represented as a snake, which was passed under the clothing
and drawn over the bosom of the initiated ‘as a proof of the
incontinence of Zeus.’ Clearly then the act of initiation was the
symbolic wedding of the worshipper with the deity worshipped;
and it is probable that the union which was symbolized in this
life was expected to be realised in the next.</p>

<p>Finally in the orgiastic worship of Cybele the same religious
doctrine is revealed. Here to Attis seems to be assigned the same
part as to Adonis in the mysteries of Aphrodite. He is the
beloved of the goddess; he is lost and mourned for as dead;
he is restored again from the grave to the goddess who loved him.
And in all this he appears to be the representative of all Cybele’s
worshippers; for the ritual of initiation into her rites, if once
again we may avail ourselves of Clement’s statements, is strongly
imbued with the idea of marriage between the goddess and her
worshipper. The several acts or stages of initiation are summarised
in four phrases: ‘I ate out of the drum; I drank out of
the cymbal; I carried the sacred vessel; I entered privily the
bed-chamber&mdash;<span class="greek">ἐκ τυμπάνου ἔφαγον· ἐκ κυμβάλου ἔπιον· ἐκερνοφόρησα·
ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν</span><a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>. In the passage from which
these phrases are culled there appears to be a certain confusion
between the rites of Cybele and those of Demeter; but the
fact that Clement shortly afterwards gives another formulary of
Demeter’s ritual is sufficient proof that he meant this present
formulary, as indeed the mention of kettle-drum and cymbal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[587]</span><a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>
suggests, to apply to the mysteries of Cybele<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a>. It appears then
that the final act or stage of initiation consisted in the secret
admission of the worshipper to the bed-chamber of the goddess.
Such ritual can have borne only one interpretation. It clearly
constituted a promise of wedded union between the initiated and
their deity. Viewed in this light even the emasculation of the
priests of Cybele may more readily be understood; it may have
been the consecration of their virility to the service of the goddess,
a final and convincing pledge of celibacy in this life, in return
for which they aspired to be blest by wedlock with their goddess
hereafter.</p>

<p>The mention of the goddess’ bed-chamber in the above passage
is of considerable interest. The <span class="greek">παστός</span> (or <span class="greek">παστάς</span>) in relation
to a temple meant the same thing as it often meant in relation to
an ordinary house, an inner room or recess screened off, and in
particular a bridal chamber. Such provision for the physical
comfort of the deity was probably not rare. Pausanias tells us
that on the right of the vestibule in the Argive Heraeum there
was a couch (<span class="greek">κλίνη</span>) for Hera<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>, and he seems to speak of it as if it
were a common enough piece of temple furniture. So too at
Phlya in Attica, where were held the very ancient mystic rites ‘of
her who is called the Great,’ there was a bridal chamber (<span class="greek">παστάς</span>),
where, it has rightly been argued, there ‘must have been enacted
a mimetic marriage<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a>.’ Again Clement of Alexandria speaks of a
<span class="greek">παστός</span> of Athena in the Parthenon, and makes it quite clear by
the story which he relates that he understood the word in the
sense of bed-chamber. The story is also for other reasons worth
recalling, because it shows how the religious conception of marriage
between men and gods was readily extended to the worship of
other deities than those whose mysteries we have sought to
unravel, and at the same time furnishes the only case known to
me in which that mystic belief was prostituted to the base
uses of flattery. The occasion was the reception accorded by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[588]</span>
Athenians to Demetrius Poliorcetes. Not content with hailing
him as a god in name, they went so far in their mean-spirited
subjection as to set up a temple, at the place where he dismounted
from his horse on entering their city, to Demetrius the Descender
(<span class="greek">Καταιβάτης</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>, while on every side altars were erected to him.
But their grossest piece of flattery was a master-piece of grotesque
impiety, and met with a fitting reward. A marriage was arranged
between him (the most notorious profligate of his age) and Athena.
‘He however,’ we are told, ‘disdained the goddess, being unable
to embrace the statue, but took with him to the Acropolis the
courtesan Lamia, and polluted the bed-chamber of Athena, exhibiting
to the old virgin the postures of the young courtesan<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>.’
Even that contemptuous response to the Athenians’ flattery
did not abash them, but, finding that he did not favour their
acknowledged deity, they determined to deify his acknowledged
favourite, and erected a temple to Lamia Aphrodite<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>.</p>

<p>But such travesties of holy things were rare; and this one
notorious case excited the contempt alike of the man<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> to whom
the flattery was paid and of all posterity&mdash;a contempt which
teaches, hardly less clearly than the indignation excited a century
earlier by the supposed profanation of the mysteries, in what
reverence and high esteem the idea of marriage between men and
gods was generally held.</p>

<p>Even Lucian, in whom reverence was a less pronounced
characteristic than humour, condemns seriously enough a parody
of the mysteries of Eleusis which occurred in his own day; and
his account of it at the same time shows once more that the
marriage of men and gods was the very essence of the mysteries.
The impostor Alexander, he says, instituted rites with carrying
of torches (<span class="greek">δᾳδουχία</span>) and exposition of the sacred ceremonies
(<span class="greek">ἱεροφαντία</span>) lasting for three days. “On the first there was a
proclamation, as at Athens, as follows: ‘If any atheist, Christian,
or Epicurean hath come to spy upon the holy rites, let him begone,
and let the faithful be initiated with heaven’s blessing.’ Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[589]</span>
first of all there was an expulsion of intruders. Alexander himself
led the way, crying ‘Out with Christians,’ and the whole multitude
shouted in answer ‘Out with Epicureans.’ Then was enacted the
story of Leto in child-bed and the birth of Apollo, and his marriage
with Coronis and the birth of Asclepius; and on the second day
the manifestation of Glycon and the god’s birth<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>. And on the
third day was the wedding of Podalirius and Alexander’s mother;
this was called the Torch-day, for torches were burnt. And finally
there was the love of Selene and Alexander, and the birth of his
daughter now married to Rutilianus<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a>. Our Endymion-Alexander
was now torch-bearer and exponent of the rites. And he lay as it
were sleeping in the view of all, and there came down to him from
the roof&mdash;as it were Selene from heaven&mdash;a certain Rutilia, a
very beautiful woman, the wife of one of Caesar’s household-officers,
who was really in love with Alexander and was loved by
him, and she kissed the rascal’s eyes and embraced him in the
view of all, and, if there had not been so many torches, worse
would perhaps have followed (<span class="greek">τάχα ἄν τι καὶ τῶν ὑπὸ κόλπου
ἐπράττετο</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a>.”</p>

<p>The inferences which may be drawn from this narrative
are, first, that the mysteries in general, while reproducing in
some dramatic form the whole story of the deities concerned,
culminated in the representation of a mystic marriage between
men and gods; (the birth of a child was also represented or
announced in this parody, as we know that it was at Eleusis<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a>, but
it had, I am inclined to think, no mystic significance otherwise
than as proof of the consummation of that marriage;) and, secondly,
that the wild charges of indecency brought by early Christian
writers against the mysteries are baseless; for Lucian condemns
a much lesser license in this parody than that which they attributed
to the genuine rites.</p>

<p>Thus our examination of the mysteries, so far as they are
known to us, tends to prove that the doctrines revealed in them to
the initiated were simply a development of certain vaguer popular
ideas which have been prevalent among the Greek folk from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[590]</span>
classical age down to our own day. The people entertained hopes
that this physical life would continue in a similar form after death;
the mysteries gave definite assurance of that immortality by
exhibiting to the initiated Persephone or Adonis or Attis restored
from the lower world in bodily form; and though that exhibition
was in fact merely a dramatic representation, yet to the eyes of
religious ecstasy it seemed just as much a living reality as does
the risen Christ in the modern celebration of Easter. The
people again were wont to think and to speak of death as a
marriage into the lower world; the mysteries showed to the
initiated certain representatives of mankind who by death, or even
in life, had been admitted to the felicity of wedlock with deities,
and thereby confirmed the faithful in their happier hopes of being
in like manner themselves god-beloved and of sharing the life
of gods.</p>

<p>Since then there is good reason to believe that this was in
effect the secret teaching of the mysteries, it would naturally
be expected that human marriage should have been reckoned
as it were a foretaste of that union with the divine which was
promised hereafter, and also that death should have been counted
the hour of its approaching fulfilment; in other words, if my
view of the mysteries is correct, it would almost inevitably follow
that the mysteries should have been brought into close association
both with weddings and with funerals. This expectation is confirmed
by the facts.</p>

<p>An ordinary wedding was treated as something akin to
initiation into the mysteries. An inscription of Cos<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a>, relating to
the appointment of priestesses of Demeter, mentions among other
duties certain services on the occasion of weddings; and the
brides, who are the recipients of these services, are divided into
two classes, <span class="greek">αἱ τελεύμεναι</span> and <span class="greek">αἱ ἐπινυμφευόμεναι</span>, the maidens
who, are being ‘initiated,’ and the widows who are being married
again; a woman’s first marriage in fact is called by a religious
document her initiation, and Demeter’s priestesses are charged
therewith. Nor was this usage or idea confined to Cos; Plutarch
speaks of services rendered by the priestess of Demeter in the
solemnisation of matrimony as part of an ‘ancestral rite<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a>’; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[591]</span>
the term <span class="greek">τέλος</span> was commonly used both of the mystic rites and of
marriage, and <span class="greek">τέλειοι</span> might denote the newly-wed<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a>.</p>

<p>The same thought seems also to have inspired another custom
associated with marriage. The newly-wed, we hear, sometimes
attended a representation of the marriage of Zeus and Hera<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>,
an <span class="greek">ἱερὸς γάμος</span> which formed the subject of mystic drama or
legend all over Greece<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a>. The widely extended cults of Hera
under the titles of Maiden (<span class="greek">παρθένος</span> or <span class="greek">παῖς</span>) and of Bride
(<span class="greek">τελεία</span> or <span class="greek">νυμφευομένη</span>) appear to have been closely interwoven;
indeed for a full appreciation of the Greek conception of the
goddess they must be treated as complementary. They are well
interpreted by Farnell. Rejecting the theory of physical symbolism,
he suggests ‘a more human explanation. Hera was
essentially the goddess of women, and the life of women was
reflected in her; their maidenhood and marriage were solemnised
by the cults of Hera <span class="greek">Παρθένος</span> and Hera <span class="greek">Τελεία</span> or <span class="greek">Νυμφευομένη</span>,
and the very rare worship of Hera <span class="greek">Χήρα</span> might allude to the
not infrequent custom of divorce and separation<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a>.’ With, Hera
the Widow we are not here concerned, but only with the higher
conceptions of Zeus and Hera as expressed in the representation
of the ‘sacred marriage’; the bride and bridegroom who looked
upon that saw in it, we may be sure, not a symbolical representation
of the seasons and the productive powers of the earth,
but rather the divine prototype of human marriage. It reminded
them that deities, like mortals, were married and given in
marriage, and it imparted to their wedding a sacramental
character, making it at once a foretaste and a gage of that close
communion with the gods which, when death the dividing line
between mortals and immortals should once be passed, awaited
the blessed among mankind.</p>

<p>Other small points too suggest the same trend of thought.
The preliminaries of a wedding often comprised a sacrifice to
Zeus Teleios and Hera Teleia<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a>, and were called <span class="greek">προτέλεια</span>
being the ‘preliminaries of initiation’ into that mystery, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[592]</span>
the sacred marriage, enacted before the now wedded pair, was
the full revelation<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a>. Again these preliminaries always included
the solemn ablution<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> of which I have spoken above, and in this
resembled the preparations for admittance to the mysteries.
Moreover an instance is recorded in which this ablution was itself
invested with the significance of a wedding between the human
and the divine. The maidens of the Troad before marriage
were wont to unrobe and bathe themselves in the Scamander;
and the prayer which they made to the river-god, whose bed they
entered, was, ‘Receive thou, Scamander, my virginity<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a>.’ Finally
the first night on which the wedded pair came together was
known as the ‘mystic night’ (<span class="greek">νὺξ μυστική</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a>, a term not a little
suggestive of the great night of Demeter’s mysteries when to
the eyes of the initiated was displayed the secret proof and
promise of wedlock between men and gods hereafter. In short
the ceremonies of a wedding by one means or another proclaimed
it to be a form of initiation, and the estate of marriage was
to the Greeks, as our prayer-book calls it, ‘an excellent
mystery.’</p>

<p>Hence naturally followed the belief that the unmarried and
the uninitiated shared the same fate in the future life. One
conception of the punishment of the uninitiated was, according
to Plato<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a>, that they should carry water in a sieve to a broken jar;
and this, as is well known, was also the lot of the Danaids in the
nether world. Commenting on these facts Dr Frazer says, ‘It is
possible that the original reason why the Danaids were believed
to be condemned to this punishment in hell was not so much
that they murdered, as that they did not marry, the sons of
Aegyptus. According to one tradition indeed they afterwards
married other husbands (Paus. <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> 12. 2); but according to
another legend they were murdered by Lynceus, apparently before
marriage (Schol. on Euripides, <i>Hecuba</i>, 886). They may therefore
have been chosen as types of unmarried women, and their
punishment need not have been peculiar to them but may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">[593]</span>
been the one supposed to await all unmarried persons in the
nether world<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a>.’ A passage of Lucian, which appears to have
been overlooked in this connexion<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a>, converts the view of the
Danaids which Dr Frazer considers possible into a practical
certainty. The passage in point forms the conclusion of that
dialogue in which Poseidon with the aid of Triton plots and
carries out the rape of Amymone, the Danaid. She has just been
seized and is protesting against her abduction and threatening
to call her father, when Triton intervenes: ‘Keep quiet, Amymone,’
he says, ‘it is Poseidon.’ And the girl rejoins, ‘Oh,
Poseidon you call him, do you?’ and then turning to her ravisher,
‘What do you mean, sirrah, by handling me so roughly, and
dragging me down into the sea? I shall go under and be
drowned, miserable girl.’ And Poseidon answers, ‘Do not be
frightened, you shall come to no harm; no, I will strike the rock
here, near where the waves break, with my trident, and will let
a spring burst up which shall bear your name, and you yourself
shall be blessed and, unlike your sisters, shall not carry water
when you are dead (<span class="greek">καὶ σὺ εὐδαίμων ἔσῃ καὶ μόνη τῶν ἀδελφῶν
οὐχ ὑδροφορήσεις ἀποθανοῦσα</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a>.’ The whole point of Poseidon’s
answer clearly depends upon the existence of a well-known belief
that the Danaids were punished hereafter for remaining unmarried
and that the punishment took the form of vainly fetching water
for that bridal bath which was a necessary preliminary to a
wedding; Amymone shall have a very thorough bridal bath, and
the spring that bears her name shall be a monument of it, while
she herself shall be ‘blessed’ by wedlock with Poseidon; thus
shall she escape the fate of the unmarried. Clearly then there
was no distinction between the uninitiated and the unmarried;
both alike were doomed vainly to fetch water for those ablutions
which preceded initiation into the mysteries or into matrimony;
and once again the conception of marriage as a mystic and
sacramental rite akin to the rites of Eleusis is clearly revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">[594]</span></p>

<p>It may further be noted here that this idea of the punishment
of the unmarried completely explains the custom, on which I have
already touched, of erecting a water-pitcher (<span class="greek">λουτροφόρος</span>) over
the grave of unmarried persons. This intimated, according to
Eustathius<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a>, that the person there buried had never taken the
bath which both bride and bridegroom were wont to take before
marriage. But this must not be taken to mean that the water-pitcher
was erected as a symbol of the punishment which the
dead person was supposed to be undergoing; this was not an
idea which his relatives and friends, even if they had held it,
would have wished to blazon abroad. One might as soon expect
to find depicted on a modern tombstone the worm that dieth not
and the fire that is not quenched. No; the water-pitcher was
not a symbol, it was an instrument; for my part I have
little faith in the existence of any symbols in popular religion
which are not in origin at least instruments; and the purpose
to which this instrument was put was to supply the dead person
with that wedding-bath which he had not taken in life, and
without which he would vainly strive in the under-world to prepare
himself for divine wedlock. The water-pitcher was not commemorative,
but preventive, of future punishment. Its erection
was not a warning to the living, but a service to the dead.</p>

<p>Thus then the evidence for the intimate association of the
mysteries, or of the main idea which runs through them, with human
weddings is complete and, I hope, convincing; and the custom
of the water-pitcher, which concludes it, fitly introduces at the
same time the evidence for the association of the same idea with
funerals. This is equally plentiful. The vague conception of
death as a wedding, which as I have shown was elaborated in
the mysteries, has of course already been exemplified in all those
passages of ancient literature and modern folk-songs which I have
adduced, and I have found in it also the motive for the assimilation
of funeral-customs to the customs of marriage. But
the evidence that the actual doctrines of the mysteries, in which
more definite expression was given to that vague idea, were closely
associated with death and funeral-custom is to be found rather in
epitaphs and sepulchral monuments.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">[595]</span></p>
<p>The tone of the epitaphs may be sufficiently illustrated by a
single couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza greek">
    <div class="verse indent0">Οὐκ ἐπιδὼν νύμφεια λέχη κατέβην τὸν ἄφυκτον</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Γόργιππος ξανθῆς Φερσεφόνης θάλαμον<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘I, Gorgippus, lived not to look upon a bridal bed ere I went
down to the chamber of bright-haired Persephone which none
may escape.’ There is naturally here a note of lament, as befits
any epitaph, and more especially that of one who dies young
and unmarried; but none the less there is an anticipation&mdash;justified,
we may think, if we will, by some ceremony of bridal
ablution performed for the dead man by his friends&mdash;that his
death is a wedding with the goddess of the under-world; and
indeed the phrase <span class="greek">Φερσεφόνης θάλαμος</span>, ‘the bridal chamber of
Persephone,’ recurs with some frequency in this class of
epitaphs<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a>.</p>

<p>Considered collectively, such epitaphs would suggest a distinctly
offensive conception of Persephone; but in each taken
separately, as it was composed, it will be allowed, I think,
that if there is supreme audacity, there is equal sublimity. It
is just these qualities which give pungency to a blasphemous
parody of such epitaphs, in which the wit of Ausonius exposes
the worst possible aspect of a religious conception which to the
pure-minded was wholly pure. My apology for quoting lines
which I will not translate must be the fact that a caricature is
often no less instructive than a true portrait. The mock epitaph
concludes as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sed neque functorum socius miscebere vulgo</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nec metues Stygios flebilis umbra lacus:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Verum aut Persephonae Cinyreius ibis Adonis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Aut Jovis Elysii tu catamitus eris<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ausonius in jest bears an unpleasant resemblance to Clement
in earnest; both perverted to their uttermost a doctrine which
commanded nothing but reverence from faithful participants in
the mysteries.</p>

<p>Akin to these epitaphs are certain tablets which recently have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">[596]</span>
been fully discussed by Miss Jane Harrison<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a>, and have been shown
to be of Orphic origin. They were buried with the dead, and
for this reason were more outspoken in their references to the
mystic doctrines than was permissible in epitaphs exposed to
the vulgar gaze. The most complete of these tablets is one which
was found near Sybaris, and, with the exception of the last sentence
of all, the inscription is in hexameter verse. Miss Harrison, to
whose work I am wholly indebted for this valuable evidence,
translates as follows<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Fate laid me low and the other Gods immortal</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">... starflung thunderbolt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have flown out of the sorrowful weary Wheel.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have passed with eager feet to the Circle desired.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have passed with eager feet from the Circle desired.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">A kid I have fallen into milk.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The gist of the document which the dead man takes with him
is then briefly this. He claims to have been pure originally
and of the same race as his gods; but as a man he was mortal
and exposed to death, and in this respect differed from his gods.
He states however that he has performed certain ritual acts which
entitle him to be re-admitted to the pure fellowship of the gods
now that death is passed. And the answer comes, ‘Thou shalt be
God instead of mortal.’</p>

<p>Now here I wish to consider one only of these ritual acts&mdash;that
one of which the meaning is clearest&mdash;<span class="greek">Δεσποίνας δ’ ὑπὸ
κόλπον ἔδυν χθονίας βασιλείας</span>, which means, if I may give my
own rendering, ‘I was admitted to the embrace of Despoina,
Queen of the under-world.’ The phrase is one which repeats the
idea which we have already seen expressed in the formulary of
Cybele’s rites, <span class="greek">ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν</span><a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a>, ‘I was privily admitted
to the bridal chamber,’ and in the token of the Sabazian mysteries,
<span class="greek">ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός</span><a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a>, ‘the god pressed to the bosom’; and Lucian’s
final phrase in his account of Alexander’s mock-mysteries shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">[597]</span>
a kindred phrase, <span class="greek">τὰ ὑπὸ κόλπου</span><a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>, as an euphemism of the same
kind<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a>. The Orphic therefore no less than others based his claim
to future happiness on the fact that he had performed a ritual
act, of the nature of a sacrament, which constituted a pledge that
the wedlock between him and his goddess foreshadowed here
should be consummated hereafter.</p>

<p>Even more abundant evidence is furnished by sepulchral
monuments; and in support of my views I cannot do better than
quote two high authorities who coincide in their verdict upon the
meaning of the scenes represented. In reference to those scenes
‘in which death is conceived in the guise of a marriage’
Furtwängler writes: ‘The monuments belonging to this class
are extraordinarily numerous, and exhibit very different methods
of treating the idea which they carry out. A relief upon a
sarcophagus from the Villa Borghese shows the God of the dead
in the act of carrying down the fair Kore to be his bride in
the lower world. Above the steeds of his chariot, which are
already disappearing into the depths of the earth, flies Eros as
guide. The bride however appears to be going only under
compulsion and after some struggle; the look of the bridegroom
expresses sternness rather than gentleness; and the mother who
sits with face averted seems to exclude all thoughts of the
daughter’s return. Only in the torches which the guide carries
in his hand, in the snakes which are looking upward, and in
the observant attitude of Hecate, can a suggestion of the return
be found.</p>

<p>‘On another sarcophagus&mdash;from Nazzara&mdash;which represents
the same marriage-journey, Eros is not merely the guide of the
steeds, but aids the bridegroom in carrying off Kore, so that in
this case the struggle with death takes purely the form of a
struggle with love. At the same time the mother is driving
along with her chariot, thereby signifying the renewal of life,
which is yet more clearly betokened in the ploughman and the
sower at her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">[598]</span></p>

<p>‘In a yet gentler spirit we see the same journey conceived
in a vase-painting from lower Italy. Here there is a look
of gentleness on Hades’ face; the bride accompanies him gladly,
and even takes an affectionate farewell of her mother, who
appears to acquiesce in her departure. In this case too Eros
is flying above the horses, and is turned towards the lovers, while
in front of him there flies a dove, the bird sacred to the goddess
of love. Hecate with torches guides the steeds; near at hand
waits Hermes to escort the procession; and above the whole
scene the stars are shining, as if to indicate the new life in the
region of death.</p>

<p>‘In another form, exalted to a yet higher holiness, the
same marriage is repeated in the sphere of Dionysus-worship.
Thus on a cameo in the Vatican, Dionysus is represented
driving with his bride, Ariadne, in a brightly-decked triumphal
car. Holy rapture is manifested on the features of both, and
on top of the chariot stands a Cupid directing it. Dionysus
is arrayed in the doe-skin, and holds in his left hand a
<i>thyrsus</i>, in his right a goblet; Ariadne is carrying ears of corn
and poppy-heads, and has her hair wreathed with vine-leaves.
The car is drawn by Centaurs of both sexes, with torches,
drinking-horns, and musical instruments. The idea which underlies
this scene is the reproduction of Life out of Death; Hades
has issued forth again for a new marriage-bond with Kore in the
realm of light, appearing now rejuvenated in the form of Dionysus,
just as his bride assumes the form of Ariadne, and because the
power of death is broken behind him, his car likewise becomes
a triumphal car.</p>

<p>‘Just as the marriage of Zeus in the realm of light became
a type for men in this life, so the marriage of Hades, or of
Dionysus representing him, developed into a similar prototype
for the dead. Since that which is true of Death bears directly
upon the actual dead, it was quite natural that gradually the
process of death came to be considered in general as a wedding
with the deities of death. With this conception too harmonize
those wedding-scenes which are so common and conspicuous on
funeral monuments, as well as the often-recurring scenes from the
joyous cycle of Dionysus-myths<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a>.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[599]</span></p>
<p>Two brief comments may be made upon this passage. First,
Furtwängler clearly recognises in Dionysus a mere substitute for
Hades, and thus confirms my interpretation of the strange legend
concerning Dionysus and Prosymnus<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a>. We noticed that the
somewhat obscure observation of Heraclitus (as quoted by
Clement) upon that story contained the words ‘Dionysus and
Hades are one and the same’; and we now see that in art too
the same identification was made, and that the marriage of a
mortal with Dionysus was used to typify the future marriage of
the dead with their gods. The reason for this identification seems
simply to be that the cults in which the two gods figured, although
differing in outward form, were felt to express one and the same
idea&mdash;namely the conception of death as a form of marriage; and
the tendency to identify in such cases was carried so far that the
god Dionysus was even, we are told, identified with the mortal
Adonis<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a>, presumably because the worship of each, as I have
shown above, turned upon this one cardinal doctrine.</p>

<p>Secondly, Furtwängler points out that the marriage of Zeus
and Hera represented for living men the same doctrine as the
marriage of Hades and Persephone (or of Dionysus and Ariadne)
represented for the dead. The truth of this is well illustrated by
the close resemblance between Aristophanes’ picture of Hera’s
wedding and those funeral monuments and vases which Furtwängler
describes; for there too ‘golden-winged Eros held firm
the reins, and drave the wedding-car of Zeus and blessed Hera<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a>.’
In other words, this Olympian marriage was only one among
several mystic marriages which all conveyed, though in diverse
form, the same lesson, that marriage was the perfection of divine
life no less than of human life, and therefore that hereafter
when men, or at any rate the blessed and initiated among
men, should come to dwell with their gods, no bond of
communion between gods and men could be perfect short of the
marriage-bond.</p>

<p>It was natural enough that the drama of Hera’s wedding with
Zeus should most often have been chosen to be played at an
ordinary wedding, because it would not obtrude thoughts of death
upon a joyous event with such insistence as most of the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">[600]</span>
religious legends which reposed upon the same fundamental
doctrine; but sometimes, we know, it was the priestesses of
Demeter who officiated at wedding-ceremonies, and in those cases
it cannot be doubted that it was Persephone and not Hera who
was the divine prototype of the bride, and the thought that her
wedding was a wedding with the god of death could not have been
excluded. At funerals, on the other hand, the story of Zeus and
Hera which was preferred at weddings owing to its less obvious
allusion to death, would for that same reason have found less
favour than those other marriage-legends in which the identity of
death with marriage was more clearly enunciated; and of these,
owing to the exceptional reverence in which the Eleusinian
mysteries were held, the story of Persephone seems to have
been among the most frequent. Yet in the picture drawn by
Aristophanes at which we have just glanced, for one subtle touch
which suggests the connexion of Hera’s wedding with human
weddings, there is another subtle touch which suggests its relation
with human death. The first is an epithet applied to Eros who
drove the wedding-car&mdash;the epithet <span class="greek">ἀμφιθαλής</span>, used of one who
has both parents living<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a>. The allusion to human weddings is clear.
It was no doubt imperative in old time, as it still is, in Greece,
that anyone who attended upon a bride or bridegroom, as for
instance the bearer of water for the bridal bath, should have both
parents living; and the use of the same term in reference to Eros,
the attendant upon Zeus and Hera, marks the intimate connexion
between the divine marriage and the marriage of living men and
women. But another epithet in the passage conveys no less clear
an allusion to the marriage of those, whom men call dead, with
their deities. Hera is named <span class="greek">εὐδαίμων</span>, a word which, meaning
‘favoured by God,’ may seem strangely applied to one who herself
was divine<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>. But it was selected by Aristophanes for a good
reason; by the word <span class="greek">εὐδαιμονία</span> was commonly denoted that future
bliss which the initiated believed to consist in wedlock with their
deities. Like <span class="greek">θεοφιλής</span>, ‘god-beloved,’ the term <span class="greek">εὐδαίμων</span>, ‘blessed,’
was, so to speak, a catch-word of the mysteries<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a>; and the applica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">[601]</span>tion
of it to Hera in Aristophanes’ ode brings the legend of Hera’s
marriage into rank with those other wedding-stories whose actual
plot hinged upon the identity of death and marriage. Thus
though one legend might be more appropriate in its externals to
one occasion, and another legend to another occasion, the ultimate
and fundamental idea of them all was single and the same.</p>

<p>This view is boldly championed by the second authority whom
I proposed to quote upon the subject of mystic marriage-scenes
depicted on funeral-monuments. ‘The idea,’ says Lenormant, ‘of
mystic union in death is frequently indicated in the scenes represented
upon <i>sarcophagi</i> and painted vases. But for the most part
the idea is expressed there only in an allusive manner, which depends
upon the identification which this marriage-scene established
between the dead person and the deity, by means of such subjects
as the carrying off of Cephalus by Aurora, or Orithyia by Boreas,
or the love-story of Aphrodite and Adonis<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a>.’ ‘Thus,’ he explains,
‘a girl carried off (by death) from her parents was simply a bride
betrothed to the infernal god, and was identified with Demeter’s
maiden daughter, the victim of the passion and violence of Hades;
a young man cut off by an early fate figured as the beautiful
Adonis, snatched away by Persephone from the love of Aphrodite,
and brought, in spite of himself, to the bed of the queen of the
lower world<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a>.’ The identification which Lenormant sees in these
several instances is an identification, I suppose, not of personalities
but of destinies. The popular religion of ancient Greece shows
little trace of any pantheistic view which would have contemplated
the absorption of the personality of the dead man or woman
into that of any god or goddess. Indeed the very number of the
personally distinct deities with whom, on such an hypothesis, the
dead would have been identified, as well as that continuance of
sexual difference in the future life which is postulated by the very
doctrine before us, precludes all thought of personal identification.
Rather it is the future destiny of the dead person which was
identified with the destiny of the deity or hero whose marriage
was represented on sarcophagus or <i>cippus</i> or commemorative vase<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a>.
The lot of Kore or Ariadne or Orithyia prefigured the lot of mortal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">[602]</span>
women hereafter; the fortunes of Adonis or Cephalus typified
those of mortal men; and all the marriage-scenes alike, whatever
the differences of presentation, revealed the hope and the promise
of wedlock hereafter between mankind and their deities.</p>

<p>But Lenormant mentions one vase-painting<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> in which this
fundamental doctrine is taught not by parables of mythology, but
more overtly and directly. The scene depicted is the marriage of
a youth, whose name, Polyetes, is in pathetic contrast with his
short span of years spent upon earth, with a goddess Eudaemonia
(or ‘Bliss’) in the lower world. In this deity Lenormant sees ‘the
infernal goddess under an euphemistic name.’ Nor could any more
significant name have been used. It has already been pointed out
that <span class="greek">εὐδαιμονία</span> was a term much favoured by the initiated in the
mysteries, and was openly used by them to denote that future
bliss which secretly was understood to consist in divine wedlock.
Hence the scene upon this vase would at once suggest to those
who were familiar with the doctrines of the mysteries, that the
youth, being presumably of the number of the initiated, had found
in death the realisation of his happy hopes and had entered into
blissful union with the goddess of the lower world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To sum up briefly: we have seen alike in the literature of
ancient Greece and in the folk-songs of modern Greece that death
has commonly been conceived by the Hellenic race in the guise
of a wedding; a review of marriage-customs and funeral-customs
both ancient and modern has re-affirmed the constant association of
death and marriage, and has shown how deep-rooted in the minds
of the common people that idea must have been which produced
a deliberate assimilation of funeral-rites to the ceremonies of
marriage. Next we investigated the connexion of the mysteries
with the popular religion, and saw reason to hold that, far from
being subversive of it or alien to it, they inculcated doctrines
which were wholly evolved from vaguer popular ideas always
current in Greece. Finally we traced in many of those legends,
on which the dramatic representations of the mysteries are known
to have been based, a common <i>motif</i>, the idea that death is the
entrance for men into a blissful estate of wedded union with their
deities. And this religious ideal not only satisfies the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">[603]</span>
agreement with, and evolution from, those popular views in which
death figured somewhat vaguely as a form of wedding, but also
proves to be the natural and necessary outcome of two religious
sentiments with which earlier chapters have dealt; first, the ardent
desire for close communion with the gods, and secondly, the belief
that men’s bodies as well as their souls survived death and dissolution;
for if the body by means of its disintegration rejoined the
soul in the nether world, and the human entity was then complete,
enjoying the same substantial existence, the same physical
no less than mental powers, which it had enjoyed in the upper
world, and which the immortal gods enjoyed uninterrupted by
death, then, since the same rite of marriage was the consummation
both of divine life and of human life, men’s yearning for close
communion with their gods required for its ideal and perfect satisfaction
the full union of wedlock; and the sacrament which assured
men of this consummation was the highest development of the
whole Greek religion, the mysteries.</p>

<p>Such a sacrament and such aspirations might well have
offended even those Christians of early days, if such there were,
who were willing to deal sympathetically with paganism; that
those who were its declared enemies, and were ready to use against
it the weapons of perversion and vituperation, found in this conception
a vulnerable point, is readily understood. It is true
indeed that in the very idea which they most vilified there was
a certain curious analogy between the new religion and the old.
Just as paganism allowed to each man or woman individually
the hope of becoming the bridegroom or the bride of one of their
many deities, so Christianity represented the Church, the whole
body of the faithful collectively, as the bride of its sole deity. But
the analogy is superficial only. The bond of feeling which united
the Church with God was very differently conceived from that
which drew together the pagans and their deities. The chastened
‘charity’ (<span class="greek">ἀγάπη</span>) of the Christians had little in common with the
passionate love (<span class="greek">ἔρως</span>) with which the Greeks of old time had
dared look upon their gods. Theirs was the Love that ‘held firm
the reins and drave the wedding-car of Zeus and blessed Hera<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a>’;
the Love that hovered above the steeds of Hades and changed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[604]</span>
Persephone the road of death into a road to bliss; the Love whom
‘no immortal may escape nor any of mankind whose life passeth it
as a day, but whoso hath him is as one mad<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>’; and the only true
consummation of such love was wedlock.</p>

<p>This conception necessarily implied the equality of men with
their gods in the future life; and that future equality was sometimes
represented as no more than a return to that which was in
the beginning. ‘One is the race of men with the race of gods;
for one is the mother that gave to both our breath; yet are they
sundered by powers wholly diverse, in that mankind is as naught,
but heaven is builded of brass that abideth ever unshaken<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a>.’ So
sang Pindar of the past and of the present; but the Orphic
tablet which has been already quoted carries on the thought into
the future:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Fate laid me low....’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So far with Pindar. But the dead man’s claims do not end there:
‘I was admitted to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld’;
already had he received a foretaste of that divine wedlock
which implied equality with the gods; and so there comes the
answer, ‘Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of
mortal.’</p>

<p>This idea commended itself even to thinkers who did not
believe in bodily survival after death. Plato, in the <i>Phaedo</i>,
where above all things is taught the perishable nature of the
body and the immortality of the soul alone, yet avails himself of
the belief that the pure among mankind shall attain even to godhead
hereafter. To him the pure are not the initiated indeed, but
the earnest strivers after wisdom. In his theory of retributive
metempsychosis he surmises that those who have followed the
lusts of the flesh shall hereafter enter the ranks of asses and other
lustful beasts; that those who have wrought violence shall enter
the ranks of wolves and hawks and kites; that those who have
practised what is popularly accounted virtue, but without true
understanding, shall enter the ranks of harmless and social
creatures, bees, wasps, and ants, or even the ranks of men once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">[605]</span>
more. ‘But into the ranks of gods none may enter without
having followed after wisdom and so departing hence wholly pure&mdash;none
save the lover of knowledge<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a>.’ What precise meaning
Plato attached to his phrase ‘to enter the ranks’ (<span class="greek">εἰς γένος ἐνδύεσθαι</span>
or <span class="greek">ἀφικνεῖσθαι</span>), to which he adheres throughout the
passage, is a question which agitated the Neoplatonists<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> somewhat
needlessly. The phrase is intended either literally throughout
or allegorically throughout. If it be allegorical, the meaning
must be that all human souls shall enter again into human bodies,
but that they shall start this new phase of existence with the
qualities of lust, violence, respectability, or real virtue and purity,
acquired in the previous life&mdash;merely resembling, as nearly as men
may, asses, wolves, bees, or gods. Now as regards the first three
classes, this allegorical interpretation, if a little forced, is feasible
enough; but what of the fourth class? Shall the soul which has
attained purity, the very negation of fleshliness in Plato’s view, suffer
re-incarnation and struggle once more against the flesh? Surely
the allegorical explanation is at once condemned. The phrase was
intended literally<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>. Plato signified the re-incarnation of the lustful,
the violent, and the merely respectable, in the forms of animals of
like character, and he signified&mdash;I must not say the re-incarnation,
for Plato’s gods were spiritual and not carnal&mdash;but the regeneration
of the pure in the form of gods. And in the same spirit
Plutarch too contemplated the possibility of some men’s souls
becoming first heroes, and from heroes rising to the rank of
‘daemons,’ and from ‘daemons’ coming to share, albeit but rarely,
in real godhead<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus even the highest aspirations of the most spiritually-minded
of pagan thinkers owed much to the purely popular
religion. The Orphic tablet links up the popular conception of
death as a wedding with the Platonic conception of the deification
of the soul. ‘I was admitted to the embrace of Despoina, Queen
of the underworld’: ‘Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God
instead of mortal.’</p>

<p>But if Plato, even in his conception of a purely spiritual life
hereafter, owed something to the popular religion, he drew upon it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[606]</span>
far more freely in his conception of Love. In the <i>Symposium</i> one
speech after another culminates in the assertion of that belief
which found its highest expression in the mysteries. ‘So then I
say,’ says Phaedrus, ‘that Love is the most venerable of the gods,
the most worthy of honour, the most powerful to grant virtue and
blessedness unto mankind both in life and after death<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a>.’ And in
the same tone too Eryximachus: ‘He it is that wields the
mightiest power and is the source for us of all blessedness and
of our power to have loving fellowship both with one another
and with the gods that are stronger than we<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a>.’ And finally
Aristophanes: It is Love, ‘who in this present life gives us most
joys by drawing like unto like, and for our hereafter displays hopes
most high, if we for our part display piety towards the gods, that
he will restore us to our erstwhile nature and will heal us and will
make us happy and blessed<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a>.’</p>

<p>This is not Platonic philosophy but popular religion. Phrase
after phrase reveals the origin of this conception of Love. The
hopes most high were the hopes held forth by the mysteries; the
blessedness and the loving fellowship with gods were the fulfilment
of those hopes. In such language did men ever hint at the
joys to which their mystic sacraments gave access. And Plato
here ventures yet further. The author of those high hopes, the
founder of that blessedness, he proclaims, is none other than Love&mdash;Love
that appealed not to the soul only of the initiated, but to
the whole man, both soul and body&mdash;Love that meant not only
the yearning after wisdom and holiness and spiritual equality with
the gods, but that same passion which drew together man and
woman, god and goddess&mdash;the passion of mankind for their deities,
fed in this life by manifold means of communion and even by
sacramental union, satisfied hereafter in the full fruition of wedded
bliss.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> The name is probably derived from the ancient <span class="greek">βράγχος</span>, with metathesis of
the nasal sound. If <span class="greek">βράγχος</span> means congestion of the throat, the modern formation
in <span class="greek">-ᾶς</span> would mean ‘one who causes congestion,’&mdash;apparently of other parts besides
the throat. The by-forms <span class="greek">Βαραχνᾶς</span> and <span class="greek">Βαρυχνᾶς</span> seem to have been influenced by
a desire to connect the name with <span class="greek">βαρύς</span>, ‘heavy.’ Under the ancient name of this
demon, ‘Ephialtes,’ Suidas gives also a popular name of his day, <span class="greek">Βαβουτσικάριος</span>, a
word borrowed from late Latin and apparently connected with <i>babulus</i> (<i>baburrus</i>,
<i>baburcus</i>, <i>babuztus</i>) ‘foolish,’ ‘mad.’ <i>Babutsicarius</i> should then be the sender of
foolish or mad dreams. Suidas however may be in error; see below p. <a href="#Page_217">217</a>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_301" href="#FNanchor_301" class="label">[301]</a> Leo Allatius (<i>de quorumdam Graec. opinationibus</i>, cap. xx.) quotes from Mich.
Psellus (11th century) the ancient form <span class="greek">Νηρηΐδες</span> as then in use. He himself (<i>ibid.</i>
cap. xix.) employs the form <span class="greek">Ναραγίδες</span> which was probably the dialectic form of his
native Chios. Bern. Schmidt (<i>Das Volksleben der Neugriechen</i>, pp. 98&ndash;9) has brought
together a large number of variants now in use, in which the accent fluctuates
between the <span class="greek">α</span> and the <span class="greek">ι</span>, the first vowel is indifferently <span class="greek">α</span>, <span class="greek">ε</span> or <span class="greek">η</span>, the two consecutive
vowels <span class="greek">αϊ</span> are sometimes contracted to <span class="greek">ᾳ</span>, sometimes more distinctly separated
by the faintly pronounced letter <span class="greek">γ</span>, and lastly an euphonetic <span class="greek">α</span> is occasionally
prefixed to the word. Hence forms as widely distinct as <span class="greek">ἀνερᾷδες</span> and <span class="greek">ναραγίδες</span>
often occur. Du Cange, it may be added, gives the form <span class="greek">Ναγαρίδες</span> (with interchange
of the <span class="greek">ρ</span> and the inserted <span class="greek">γ</span>); but since his information is seemingly drawn
entirely from Leo Allatius, there is reason to regard it as merely his own error in
transcribing <span class="greek">Ναραγίδες</span>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_302" href="#FNanchor_302" class="label">[302]</a> An attempt has been made by one authority on the folk-lore of Athens
(<span class="greek">Καμπούρογλου, Ἱστορία τῶν Ἀθηναίων</span>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> pp. 218 and 222), to distinguish <span class="greek">καλοκυρᾶδες</span>
from <span class="greek">νεράϊδες</span>. He maintains that in Athens the latter were never regarded
as maleficent beings, and must therefore be distinguished from the dread <span class="greek">καλοκυρᾶδες</span>,
whom he seeks to identify, on no better ground than the euphemistic
name, with the Eumenides. A folk-story, however, which he himself records (<i>ibid.</i>
p. 319), how a <span class="greek">καλοκυρά</span> was married to a prince, whose eyes she had blinded to all
other women, and how after living with him for a while she disappeared finally in
a whirlwind, reveals in her all the usual traits of a Nereid, and thus defeats the
writer’s previous contention. But apart from this a little enquiry on the subject
outside the limits of Athens would have set at rest his doubts as to the identity
of the two. It is quite possible that formerly in Athens, as now elsewhere, it was
usual to employ the euphemism <span class="greek">καλοκυρᾶδες</span> in referring to the Nereids in their more
mischievous moods; only in that way can I explain his idea that the Nereids were
never maleficent.</p>

<p>These two lines (267&ndash;8) have fallen under suspicion because, it is urged, the
word <span class="greek">ἀθανάτων</span> is in direct contradiction of what has been said as to the intermediate
position of nymphs between mortals and immortals. This criticism is due
to careless reading. The lines do not mean that each tree is called the <span class="greek">τέμενος</span> of an
immortal nymph, but that a number of trees, each inhabited by a nymph, often
form together the <span class="greek">τέμενος</span> of an immortal god. A sanctuary of Artemis, for example,
might well be surrounded by trees which each harboured one of her attendant
nymphs.</p>

<p>In the copy formerly belonging to the historian Finlay and now in the possession
of the British School of Archaeology at Athens is found a note by Finlay as
follows:&mdash;‘Joh. Wilh. Zinkeisen in Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches in Europa
(Gotha, 1854), vol. ii. p. 90, note 2, mentions a second printed copy as existing in
the Mazarine Library at Paris, and a manuscript copy in possession of Justiniani
family at Genoa. The date according to Zinkeisen should be not MDVI but
MDCVI.’ There is no designation of the press or place from which the volume
issued.</p>

to that class of modern Greek writers who exhibit their own intellectual emancipation
by deploring or deriding popular superstitions, and wastes so much energy therein
that he fails to note such points of interest. But, since it is not probable that the
peasants of Epirus eat meat more often than other Greek peasants, the connexion
of the sacrifice and the divination may, I think, be assumed.</p>

but I very strongly suspect that in Antiphon, p. 127 (init.), <span class="greek">προστρέψομαι</span> should
be read instead of <span class="greek">προστρίψομαι</span>. A man accused of murder is saying, <span class="greek">ἀδίκως μὲν

were really guilty of this murder and yet owing to the feeble case presented by the
prosecutor I were acquitted by you, my escape would bring the Avenger of the dead
man upon the prosecutor and not on you; whereas, if you condemn me wrongly when
I am innocent, it will be on you and not on him that I, after death, shall turn the
wrath of the Avengers.’ Clearly <span class="greek">προστρέψομαι</span> is required to answer <span class="greek">προστρόπαιον</span>,

cremation were discovered. Yet in his concluding summary he says: “Burial, not
burning, of the dead was in those times the more prevalent custom, since in one
case and one only can we admit that the corpse was not buried but burnt.” I
note that Brückner and Pernice (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 149) in referring to Philios’ results
tacitly soften his rigid ‘one and one only’ into the more supple ‘one or two.’

<p><a id="Footnote_1320" href="#FNanchor_1320" class="label">[1320]</a> Rohde (<i>Psyche</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> cap. 1) contends that the discovery of an altar, of the type
used in the worship of Chthonian deities, superimposed upon one Mycenaean grave,
proves both that offerings to the dead were continued after the interment and also
that the offerings were of a propitiatory character. On this slight foundation he
rears the edifice of his theory that a vigorous soul-cult flourished in Mycenaean
and earlier ages. Accordingly he views all gifts to the dead, including those made
at the time of the funeral, as offerings intended to propitiate departed souls,
although he is forced to admit that from the Homeric age onwards there is no
evidence that fear of the dead was a feature of Greek religion; the offerings
made, on his view, to the soul of Patroclus were merely, he holds, a ‘survival,’ a
custom no longer possessed of any meaning. The accident of an altar belonging
to some Chthonian deity having been found above the grave of some man seems to
me insufficient basis for any theory.</p>

seems hardly to tally with that which she suggests later (p. 600), “Burial itself may
well have been to them (the Pythagoreans) as to Antigone a mystic marriage:
‘I have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld.’”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
